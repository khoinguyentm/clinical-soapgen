She also reports increased sensitivity to light and finding it difficult to focus. She has taken Ibuprofen for the past two days without improvement. Other symptoms include neck stiffness, and difficulty focusing. There is no history of recent head injuries, fevers, rashes, or any other medical issues. Adriana lives with three housemates, works in IT, and wears glasses. She smokes socially and drinks only socially. She mentions a family history of migraines but has never had one herself.\n\nObjective: On examination, Adriana appears to be in mild distress. Her pupils are reactive to light without any signs of papilledema or visual field defects. There is no nystagmus, extraocular muscle palsies, or other signs of neurological deficit. Neck examination reveals no focal tenderness or stiffness.\n\nAssessment: Adriana's symptoms are consistent with a possible migraine. The fact that she has a family history of migraines supports this diagnosis. However, without a definitive clinical examination and further investigations, it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis at this stage.\n\nPlan: In the meantime, I will prescribe Adriana stronger painkillers such as Naproxen and Paracetamol or Codeine. She should keep a headache diary to help us identify any potential triggers for her headaches. Adriana is to return in one to two weeks if her headaches persist or worsen, at which point we can discuss prophylactic medications. If she experiences any visual problems, weakness in her arms and legs, or is feeling generally unwell, she should contact me immediately."}

She should avoid work until the cause of her symptoms is determined.\n\n   Plan: The patient will be asked to attend one of the clinic's locations for a physical examination and blood tests, specifically thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers. The urgency of these tests depends on the findings during the examination. If it is inconvenient for her to come into central London, she can attend a local A&E. She should not go to work until this issue is resolved. The admin team will be contacted to arrange an appointment."}

She described developing a swelling on her upper lip after consuming prawn soup around 7 PM the previous evening, which has since been getting larger and more painful. Additionally, she reported difficulty breathing and a tightness in her chest, although these symptoms were not specific to her throat. The patient mentioned a history of asthma and a peanut allergy, but was unsure about the specific medications she takes for these conditions.\n\nObjective: On physical examination, there was swelling observed on Maria's upper lip, which felt firm and tender upon palpation. The patient appeared anxious and slightly dizzy during the conversation. Her respiratory rate was elevated, and her lips were slightly cyanotic.\n\nAssessment: Maria's symptoms suggest an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, likely triggered by the prawn soup she consumed. The swelling on her lip, difficulty breathing, and tightness in her chest are indicative of this condition. Given her history of asthma and peanut allergy, it is possible that the prawns may have contained traces of peanuts or another allergen.\n\nPlan: The patient should immediately seek emergency medical attention via ambulance due to the severity of her symptoms. In the meantime, she was instructed to take any antihistamines available and have someone call emergency services (999 in the UK) to report a suspected anaphylactic reaction.

Once the diarrhea improves, he can gradually reintroduce these foods. Yoghurt was suggested due to its probiotic properties to help restore gut bacteria. If the diarrhea persists for a week or if he starts passing blood, a stool sample will be required. The patient was also advised to look out for signs of dehydration such as increased frequency of diarrhea (more than 6-8 times a day) and to seek immediate medical attention if this occurs. Over-the-counter rehydration solutions like Dioralyte were recommended. The patient was reminded that all advice given during the consultation will be recorded in his app for future reference. The patient was dismissed with instructions to take care."}

She also reported feeling anxious about her condition.\n\nObjective: On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in mild distress but was oriented and cooperative. The heart rate was 98 bpm, respiratory rate 20/minute, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
