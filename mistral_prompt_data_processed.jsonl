Um, what kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything?\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.\nDoctor: Okay. Fine. Um, and sir these started three days ago the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on. So for example, think like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms.\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.\nDoctor: Okay.\nDoctor: Do you remember where you ate?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.\nDoctor: Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms?\nPatient: Um, so no one else in the family, so a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.\nDoctor: Okay, okay. Fine. Um, alright. And uh, in terms of your , your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Or, uh\nPatient: Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.\nDoctor: Okay. And, is your asthma well-controlled?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.\nDoctor: Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, okay. Um, and apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications?\nPatient: Uh, no, no other medications.\nDoctor: Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day to day life, you said it's been affecting your life, um, in what way has it been affecting your life?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.\nDoctor: Okay.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: And have you, are you currently working at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.\nDoctor: Would, would work.\nDoctor: Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days, or have you been at home?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.\nDoctor: okay. That must be difficult for you then.\nDoctor: fine. And you said, you mentioned you live with your wife and two children, is that right?\nPatient: Yes, yeah.\nDoctor: Right, alright. Um, just a couple of other question we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all?\nPatient: Uh, no, I don't smoke.\nDoctor: And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no.\nDoctor: Okay. so um, er normally at this stage I like to um, examine you if that's okay, but um, um, but but having listened to your story, sir, I think uh, um, just to recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left-hand side, um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um, you mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and I wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: \nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Uh, mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms. Um.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids.\nPatient: \nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Um, there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Um, and if you are having vomiting diarrhea I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest.\nPatient: Okay.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again.\nPatient: Okay, sure.\nDoctor: Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Um, etcetera etcetera.\nPatient: Yep, sure, yep.\nDoctor: How's that sound?\nPatient: That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.\nDoctor: Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Um, no, no further questions, no.\nDoctor: Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear?\nPatient: Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear.

It's kind of intimate that. So I your help now.\nDoctor: Mm.\nDoctor: Mm. No no, OK. That's OK. Um\nDoctor: Fine, so just to resummarize.

So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?\nPatient: Any what?\nDoctor: Any ideas, as to what could be causing your symptoms?\nPatient: Um so I had eczema before. So maybe it's disease, but it seems like more uh, like uh my eczema was only on the arms. So, I'm I'm not sure. I I really have no idea.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um\nDoctor: To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well.\nDoctor: Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Uh your your background of eczema. Um\nDoctor: So\nDoctor: Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies.

And so I'm living with a few people to save money.\nDoctor: OK. And what do you do for work?\nPatient: Uh I work uh at a pharmaceutical company.\nPatient: So it's been a, it's been a few years now. Uh it's uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a, like a kind of project manager. Uh I mean, do you want to, to know more about it?\nDoctor: OK. Uh no no no that's , that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh you know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I'd say a few, a few beers per week. Something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger. But it's been, it's been a while.\nDoctor: OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um\nDoctor: So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um\nPatient: \nDoctor: The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back.\nDoctor: Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned using steroid creams, yesterday.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial.\nDoctor: Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um which use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter.\nDoctor: Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap.\nDoctor: Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU.\nPatient: OK. Yes, I have tried antihistamines, uh lately, but it didn't really help.\nDoctor: Ohh, could you say that again, sorry?\nPatient: I have tried uh antihistamines, but uh but it didn't really help.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. So it's something for you to think about. you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well.\nDoctor: Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um but I think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis\nDoctor: Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better.\nPatient: That sounds good.\nDoctor: OK? Um do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, no that's it. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you as well. Bye.\nDoctor: OK. Well I wish you all the best.\nDoctor: Thank you.

Um OK any other problems with for example, the brain, or? Um you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of ?\nPatient: \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, OK. Um in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis?\nPatient: Um I take the pill, Microgynon.\nDoctor: OK. And how long have you been on that for?\nPatient: three months.\nDoctor: Three months, OK. And is that mainly for contraception, or is that for something else?\nPatient: it's for contraception.\nDoctor: OK, alright.\nDoctor: That's something you meant to have a little discussion about today as well. Um\nDoctor: Uh well my next question was about um your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in the fashion industry.\nDoctor: And your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment?\nPatient: Yeah it's really stressful, actually.\nDoctor: Have you been\nPatient: having problems at like work, you know managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and, uh yeah it's not a good time.\nDoctor: . Is it getting you down?\nPatient: I don't feel down, just a little bit stressed.\nDoctor: OK, alright. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress, normally?\nPatient: Nothing really.\nDoctor: OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, OK. Um who's at home with you?\nPatient: Um, I live on my own.\nDoctor: OK. Um are you coping OK at the moment?\nPatient: Fine.\nDoctor: Yeah? OK. Um do you smoke at all? and do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Um, so normally at this I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. Um\nDoctor: That's um based on your story, um I wonder whether you may, uh may have a migraine, uh migraine type headache. Uh it sounds\nDoctor: Um, very classical of that, of that nature, the the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitivity to bright lights.\nDoctor: Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis, or indeed\nDoctor: Brain cancer, I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Um\nPatient: thank you, uh thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer. And, ohh now you say migraine. Yeah I guess my mum has similar symptoms to me and yeah, it does make sense.\nDoctor: yeah. Yeah.\nDoctor: Well, I hope that puts your, you know, mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um,\nDoctor: So I think, moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important, uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches.\nDoctor: And in terms of trying to treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, think about Paracetamol, or even Co-codamol.\nDoctor: Um, and some anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you?\nPatient: K that sounds good.\nDoctor: Um and uh, you know if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines.\nDoctor: then we could have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK. Um, now a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days, or indeed they're getting worse.\nDoctor: I'd like you to come back and see me, um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse, not responding to medications\nDoctor: Or your um neck pain is getting worse, or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. OK?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Does that sound all OK?\nPatient: Doctor, that's great.\nDoctor: Great. Any questions for me?\nPatient: No. Thank you.\nDoctor: OK. Have a good day!\nPatient: K thanks.

Um I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu.\nDoctor: Um these normally last about seven to days and just gets better really, um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself, um is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um\nDoctor: Making yourself, pushing fluids and make yourself well-hydrated. Continue with the regular Paracetamol, Ibuprofen. Um and and you should see how things go, really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me.\nDoctor: Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make\nPatient: Yeah, yeah, that's that's , it makes sense. Uh, I think I'll take a couple days off, and see how it goes.\nDoctor: Yeah, yeah.\nDoctor: and things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever, or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored, or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner, give me a call. Um and we can help you out. OK?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yeah, yeah I understand. Uh, I'll uh, I'll take care.\nDoctor: Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Bye bye.

{"id": 5, "prompt": "Below is a conversation between a doctor and a patient.\n\nTranscript:\nDoctor: Hello?\nPatient: \nDoctor: . Good morning, Tim. Um, how can I help you this morning?\nPatient: Um, so I'm\nPatient: Having some, some pain, uh, in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Um and I've just been feeling, quite, hot and sweaty.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When, when did your symptoms all start?\nPatient: About two days ago.\nDoctor: OK. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain, exactly?\nPatient: Uh, like below my belly button, it's like quite, sore when I press on it.\nDoctor: OK. Did the pain come on quite suddenly, or was it more gradual?\nPatient: , it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it is getting a bit worse now.\nDoctor: OK, OK. And can you describe the pain to me?\nPatient: Uh, it's kind of like a, a, I guess a burning pain. Uh, and it's just right there yeah, in that spot, like uh, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Just in, just below your belly button you uh, mentioned.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go?\nPatient: It's pretty constant, it's like getting worse. Um, it's not like, I , I can still move and walk around. Uh, I mean I'm still kind of functioning, it's just uh, I'm aware of it time.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: . Mm-hmm. OK. Um, and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms, at all? So, for example, let's, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better, now. That was like, since last week.\nDoctor: OK. So you've got no other symptoms, like diarrhea or loose stools?\nPatient: No, I'm , I'm, my bowel movements are normal now.\nDoctor: No.\nDoctor: OK. And, what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm fine, that's fine, that's. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink, in colour. But I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning, specifically or hurting when I pee and uh.\nPatient: And I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more, regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids. So I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, like you know, if that was related to the pain.\nDoctor: Mm.\nDoctor: And when you mentioned pink urine, do you, was there any blood at all in your urine? Or was it difficult to say?\nPatient: I can't say, I mean maybe.\nDoctor: OK, alright. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt, uh, or or or sting, when you pass urine?\nPatient: And I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um, just that I'm, peeing more than , more regularly.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. Um, OK. And um, moving on to other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting, or feeling nauseous at all?\nPatient: Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting.\nDoctor: No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers?\nPatient: I haven't , I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say.\nDoctor: OK, fine. Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh all all all patients. This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active?\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: Uh, yeah I've, I have had the same partner, I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago.\nDoctor: OK. So you've had no other partner since then.\nPatient: No, the .\nDoctor: OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all?\nPatient: Uh, I'm, on the Implanon. I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago.\nDoctor: At the moment, OK, fine. Um, are you still having periods?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: When was your last period?\nPatient: Uh, my last period was about, three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago.\nDoctor: Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about\nPatient: Well, we don't use any other barrier, method so, we just use the , I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um.\nPatient: Theoretically, if the Implanon, hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect .\nDoctor: Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that. Um\nDoctor: OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said. It's getting worse. Um, you noticed some pink urine.\nDoctor: Um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working OK.\nDoctor: You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right?\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds, very accurate.\nDoctor: Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, anything that might be important?\nPatient: I don't think so, I think I've, you , we've covered everything that's really bothering me.\nDoctor: Yeah, OK. Um, tell me, tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well?\nPatient: Yeah, , well, I haven't had any, surgical, I don't have any surgical history.\nPatient: I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before, or, and I'm not on any other medication, I just have the Implanon.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms?\nPatient: I've never , I've never had these symptoms before.\nDoctor: No, OK. Um\nDoctor: Fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family, uh related to bowels, maybe related to history?\nPatient: No, not that , not that I'm aware of, no.\nDoctor: OK. Alright. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?\nPatient: Uh, I live in a share house, and with two other, two other room-mates.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and uh, are you currently working?\nPatient: Yeah, I currently, I am currently .\nDoctor: What do you do for work?\nPatient: I am an accountant.\nDoctor: OK. Um\nDoctor: OK. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: Uh , socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal. .\nDoctor: No, OK.\nDoctor: OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no.\nDoctor: Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already. Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.\nPatient: All right.\nDoctor: Um, how's your, how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, any\nPatient: I don't feel short of breath uh, or, I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's , worrying me.\nDoctor: OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?\nPatient: Not that it, no.\nDoctor: OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, OK. Alright. Um,\nDoctor: Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um,\nDoctor: And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's it's difficult. it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain. You don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain.\nDoctor: Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially.\nDoctor: to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, and basically those tests, we, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, it if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um,\nDoctor: Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection. And, so it's an\nPatient: . Yeah, I , can we do that instead of me, going for tests, and then seeing how that goes?\nDoctor: Yeah, absolutely. So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today.\nDoctor: Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here.\nDoctor: And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse.\nDoctor: So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera. Does that make sense?\nPatient: Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.\nDoctor: OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids.\nDoctor: You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms.\nDoctor: Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.\nPatient: Uh, sure. That sounds great. Thank you very much. Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy?\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim. Um, you can take two tablets, uh, one tablet twice a day for three days.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK, , that sounds great.\nDoctor: Uh, , let's see how you get on.\nPatient: OK.

He describes it as a burning sensation below his belly button. The pain is constant but not debilitating. Additionally, the patient has been feeling hot and sweaty.\n\nObjective: The patient's bowel movements are normal now after experiencing constipation for about a week prior. There were no symptoms of diarrhea or loose stools. The urine was pink but there was no burning or stinging pain when passing urine. The patient has been peeing more frequently, possibly due to increased fluid intake.\n\nAssessment: Tim presents with lower abdominal pain that is gradually worsening. He also reports feeling hot and sweaty. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible cause of his symptoms, especially given the pink urine. However, as he mentions a burning sensation in the lower abdomen, other possibilities such as appendicitis or a gynecological issue should be considered since he is sexually active and on hormonal contraception.\n\nPlan: Empirical treatment for a UTI with antibiotics (Trimethoprim) will be initiated. However, it's important to arrange a pregnancy test to rule out that as a possibility.

The pain is localized below the umbilicus and described as a burning sensation. He also reports feeling hot and sweaty. On examination, he notes some pinkness in his urine but denies any burning or stinging sensation while passing urine. His bowel movements are normal, and there is no reported vomiting or fever.\n\nObjective: Vital signs were not documented during the conversation, but it was noted that Tim's symptoms have been ongoing for about 48 hours. On abdominal palpation, he reports pain in the lower abdomen, particularly below his umbilicus. A urine analysis and pregnancy test are recommended as part of the objective evaluation.\n\nAssessment: The patient is experiencing lower abdominal pain that may be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI), gut issue, or pregnancy-related cause. The pinkness in the urine suggests possible UTI or hematuria, which needs further investigation.\n\nPlan: Tim will start antibiotics (Trimethoprim) for empirical treatment of UTI. He is advised to take two tablets once a day for three days and drink plenty of fluids. A pregnancy test is recommended to rule out any potential pregnancy-related causes. Tim should return if his symptoms do not improve or worsen, and he will be instructed on what signs to look out for (e.g., increased tummy pain, temperature, vomiting).

Um, and again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for?\nPatient: Um, I kind of noticed it the last few days.\nDoctor: Past few days, OK. And is this something that you've had before, in the past?\nPatient: Uh, I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time, the heart failure was a problem.\nDoctor: OK. OK. Um, fine. OK. So, um, just to really recap, uh, so you're really, in the last couple of weeks, uh, you've been feeling breathless, uh, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough.\nDoctor: Um, and some swelling in your ankles. Um, reporting no chest pain.

Um, I uh, I had, I, I had like some chest pain and, they took me into hospital.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And um, they, uh, but then I just got better.\nDoctor: OK. And when, when you say a small heart attack, did they give you a name, for what happened, a, a name of a diagnosis?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Uh, I can't remember. They just called it something a , uh, something like that, a small heart attack.\nDoctor: It's more hard to say. OK. Was it like angina or, um,\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Uh, no they, they said that it, uh, it seemed, it was like, more than angina.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Um, uh, but um, I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days, and, uh.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And yeah, I've been OK since then.\nDoctor: You've been OK since then. OK, alright. So, apart from the uh, the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of?\nPatient: Uh, no, I think I'm otherwise, I'm OK.\nDoctor: OK. Um, do you take any regular medications, apart from your diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, I take something called Furosemide.\nDoctor: .

I take Aspirin.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And uh, Bisoprolol.\nDoctor: The Metoprolol, was it?\nDoctor: Or?\nPatient: Uh, Bisoprolol.\nDoctor: Sorry, the connection's not very good. OK. Thank you, yeah.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, .\nDoctor: And a thousand, OK. Alright. Any allergies at all? Any medications?\nPatient: Uh, no, no allergies.\nDoctor: No.\nDoctor: OK. And is there anything in the family that's, uh, that, that's uh, that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems?\nPatient: Uh , my, my father died of a, uh, of a heart attack.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. And, um, how old was your father when he passed away?\nPatient: Uh, he was, um, early sixties.\nDoctor: Early sixties, OK. Alright. Anything else I should be aware of?\nPatient: Um, my mother had osteoporosis.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Is your mother still with us?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, she's still living.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Um, and socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you?\nPatient: Uh, I live on my own. Well, I got two cats.\nDoctor: You've got two cats. OK, great.

And um, in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, I work part-time as, a, uh, lorry driver.\nDoctor: OK. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours?\nPatient: Uh, it's OK. Um, I uh, yeah , when I'm working it's pretty exhausting.\nDoctor: Mm.\nPatient: Um, I guess I'm a bit worried, that if I get sick I won't, if I get more sick then, I won't be able to work properly.\nDoctor: Yeah, that's certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon, so it doesn't have any um, impact on your, on your job.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Uh, and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Do you , do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving?\nDoctor: \nPatient: Ohh no, I , I , I, I only take shifts during the day, I don't like working at night.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, 'cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you, do you smoke at all?\nPatient: Not any more.\nDoctor: So, you used to smoke?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: And how many did you smoke a day, on average?\nPatient: Ooh it was about, about a pack a day, back in the day.\nDoctor: Um, and how many, how many years was that for?\nPatient: Ohh that was, oof, good twenty five years.\nDoctor: OK. And what about the stopping? That must have been difficult for you. stopping. Um, and what, what about alcohol?\nPatient: I don't drink alcohol.\nDoctor: OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir?\nPatient: Uh, I try and walk to the shops, at least once a day.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Um, but uh, that's about it, I've. Yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when i was young.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the uh, to the shop, she said.\nDoctor: Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um,\nDoctor: Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh,\nPatient: Mmm.\nPatient: That.\nDoctor: It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously\nPatient: What's going on.\nDoctor: Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options move forward. Um,\nPatient: Mmm.\nDoctor: Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK,\nDoctor: I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.\nDoctor: Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.\nPatient: OK. If you think that'll be better.\nDoctor: Uh,\nDoctor: I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good\nPatient: What does that?\nPatient: Ohh yes, I remember now.\nDoctor: Sorry?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, I remember now. .\nDoctor: You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,\nDoctor: Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function.\nDoctor: Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.\nDoctor: But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable?\nPatient: I think that sounds like a good plan.\nDoctor: And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.\nPatient: OK. I'll see how I get on.\nDoctor: OK? Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much Doctor.\nDoctor: Great, and then well I wish you all the best!

Um, if you can, it'll certainly help your health as well. Um, so just to , just to summarise, I think you know, uh, based on your story.\nPatient: Thank you.\nDoctor: Um, yeah I'm not, worry.

If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and, run-down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin.\nDoctor: One tablet, three times a day. Um, uh, and , if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me, we can have another look.\nPatient: \nPatient: All right, OK.

And, has this spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your, to your chest, your legs, your face?\nPatient: \nDoctor: No, OK. So apart from being dry and itchy, um, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been, uh, have you noticed any cracked skin?\nPatient: Um, so my skin's quite red, um, and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days.\nDoctor: OK.

Well I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope it gets better.\nDoctor: Um, going back to your skin. I mean is it anything you've done perhaps, uh, which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched or, you know, for example shower gels, soaps, fabric , fabric cleaners?\nPatient: , I went swimming a few days ago.\nDoctor: OK. Is that the first time in your life or have you been before?\nPatient: Uh, no, I've been before.\nDoctor: OK.

Is that something you're, is that, does that ring a bell now?\nPatient: Ohh yeah.\nDoctor: OK.

Medication allergies?\nPatient: I think, um, I might be lactose intolerant.\nDoctor: Lactose intolerant, OK, that could be helpful to know. Um, fine. And tell me of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of?\nPatient: Um, yeah, so um, my dad has asthma, and, my mum has hayfever.\nDoctor: Hayfever, OK. Um, fine, but any, again, any skin problems that you're aware of?\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: No, OK, all right.

And you said you , you work as a primary school teacher?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Uh , the reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a , contributing factor. Um, you felt, you noticed yourself, find, uh, , life's been more stressful recently. Is that right?\nDoctor: Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms?\nPatient: I don't. I certainly think so.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Um, fine. Um.\nDoctor: OK, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but um, based on your uh, story.\nDoctor: Um, it's difficult. I think that, you know, , you've, essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your, mainly your hands. you mentioned. Um and your arms which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago.\nDoctor: Um, but no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um, have you heard of that condition before?\nPatient: I have, yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Um, great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but, um, it, it's something that we can readily treated. Um.\nDoctor: With couple options, we have steroid creams I can give you, um, which will help with the inflammation.\nDoctor: And, uh, something called emollients, which can help with the dry, dry skin.\nDoctor: And that's something you just need to kind of paste on, uh, on to your skin, uh, , throughout the day for the next few days. Um, and hopefully that helps your symptoms.\nPatient: OK, it's cool. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: Um, , you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine, they can sometimes help with the itchiness.\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds good.\nDoctor: OK. And um, that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion, wouldn't be helpful.\nDoctor: Um, uh, uh, painkillers wouldn't be helpful , on this occasion, but let's, let's, let's see how the next few days go.\nDoctor: And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week, and we can have another look again, at your symptoms.\nPatient: OK, perfect. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: Right. Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: OK. Well, I wish you all the best. Have a good day.\nPatient: Well, thank you very much.

Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers?\nPatient: Uh, I don't know, maybe a doctor someday, you never know.\nDoctor: , recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, , do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: Uh, I don't, I don't smoke, uh, I do drink, like on the weekends, yeah.\nDoctor: , so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down.\nDoctor: Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly.\nPatient: \nDoctor: I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.\nDoctor: Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK?\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell.\nDoctor: Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this?\nDoctor: Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,.\nPatient: OK, OK. Uh, that, that makes sense. Ohh, OK, thank you so much.\nDoctor: All right.\nDoctor: Great.\nDoctor: Thank you very much.

Hi.\nDoctor: Right excellent, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please?\nPatient: Yeah I can hear you, hi.\nPatient: Sure, um, I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm nineteen years old.\nDoctor: Nineteen years old OK Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon?\nPatient: Um, so it's being going on for a few days now.

I've uh it quite hurts when I kind of pee.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more, um.\nPatient: And it's really, like I can't, like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm, like in at the bottom of my tummy as well.\nDoctor: Right OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can, see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, you said you're going to the toilet more often as well, that right?\nPatient: Uh, yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Um.\nDoctor: Ohh and a week, sorry my . OK, uh.\nPatient: Sorry no I didn't explain it properly before, um yeah no I it's been going on for about just under a week.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, and yeah I notice a sort of burning, stinging, when I when I go to the toilet, yeah.\nDoctor: Are you noticing any, anything in your urine, predominantly blood or um, discolouration of urine?\nPatient: Um, I think, well today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink.\nPatient: The, the urine.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK, uh of any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all, in your urine?\nPatient: Yeah, I think just today .\nPatient: Um, I think it was probably but I don't know it was pink so.\nDoctor: OK. Um, fine we'll we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit or detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain?\nPatient: Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, um, uh mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse.\nDoctor: OK. Um, can you describe it crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain?\nPatient: Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain, it's a bit different, it's, it's hard to say, an achey pain I suppose.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: An aching pain, OK. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back? Towards your sides?\nPatient: No, no, no.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Um, any other symptoms? Nausea? Vomiting?\nPatient: No, no nausea vomiting.\nDoctor: OK. Any temperatures or fevers?\nPatient: Um no, no not that I've noticed.\nDoctor: OK, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working OK?\nPatient: Uh I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any, different, from what it usually is.\nDoctor: OK, and when, when when you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have?\nPatient: Um, I think I have, um, IBS, um, so I just kinda pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot.\nDoctor: Right.\nPatient: Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry if it's a bit disgusting but like, sometimes it's a bit uh harder and kind of hard to predict.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK, all right but, and you've noticed no new symptoms? No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels?\nPatient: Like, yeah OK.\nDoctor: Uh. OK, all right. Um, and Amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask? Are you currently uh, are you currently sexually active? At the moment?\nPatient: No, no, not\nPatient: Uh uh yeah um, I have a, a long-term, um, boyfriend.\nDoctor: OK, and um, have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So, from from the front passage?\nPatient: Hmm no I don't think so. Nothing unusual.\nDoctor: OK. Have you, do you use any form of contraception?\nPatient: Uh yeah, uh I'm um on the pill.\nDoctor: The pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it combined pill or the mini-pill?\nPatient: Uh, combined pill.\nDoctor: OK, fine. Um, when was the last time you had um, unprotected sex?\nDoctor: If you don't want me asking.\nPatient: Um, uh, I mean, mean unprotected as in like no, no condoms or anything?\nDoctor: Yeah, exactly.\nPatient: Um, I, I guess 'cause, um, I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend, like.\nPatient: I dunno we've just kind of agreed, uh, so um I guess, a week ago, two weeks ago , quite quite .\nDoctor: Yep, a week ago, OK all right.\nDoctor: What I'm trying get at is whether um, uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill, but um we're we, nonetheless we do have to ask. Um when was your last, when was your last period?\nPatient: \nPatient: \nPatient: Um, two weeks ago.\nDoctor: Two weeks ago OK, all right. Just something for us, to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better OK, um.\nDoctor: Fine, in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you, uh eating and drinking OK?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, yeah eating drinking OK. Um, I did have one kinda concern I dunno\nDoctor: \nPatient: So I I smoked, uh this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time.\nPatient: Uh, like a week and a half ago, I I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you.\nDoctor: Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so, I, I don't think it's is related to your symptoms, I think it probably just pure pure coincidence, um.\nPatient: Sure OK.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: But, uh, you know I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your, just for your general health moving forwards, OK?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions , apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of?\nPatient: Sure .\nPatient: No, nope.\nDoctor: No, OK great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the, um, combined pill?\nPatient: Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um it begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce like something , maybe.\nDoctor: was it, yeah OK.\nPatient: Yeah, yeah that's it. Yeah, yeah that's right.\nDoctor: OK, and is that for the cramps, the crampy pain?\nPatient: Yeah, yeah.\nDoctor: Yeah OK, and do you have any allergy to any medications?\nPatient: Um, yeah I think there was an antibiotic, um, called Clindamycin mycin .\nDoctor: OK, OK, OK.\nPatient: Then I took like something and yeah that, that didn't, go too well, with me.\nDoctor: Ritib, OK sure, I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys?\nPatient: No, no.\nDoctor: No, or generally anything else, good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you?\nPatient: Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh at uni um, so uh, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, um.\nDoctor: \nPatient: But my family, uh, live kind of outside of London not too far away. Um, so yeah the my family are fine and I see them now and then. Uh, yeah things I think, I think they're OK generally.\nDoctor: Very good.\nDoctor: Great, and what are you studying at university?\nPatient: I'm studying, uh, English.\nDoctor: English, OK good, and how are you enjoying your course?\nPatient: Yeah, yeah it's it's going well thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago and yeah I, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah it's really fun.\nDoctor: Good.\nDoctor: Very good, very good, good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either?\nPatient: Uh, as I admitted before I tried weed for the first time, uh, but, uh, I don't smoke. Uh ,I drink occasionally, um, kind of socially, um, with friends .\nDoctor: O K\nDoctor: OK, what, what's made you have your first joint last week? Was\nPatient: Um, I it was just a party,.Um, there were other people doing it, um.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: I kind of was a little bit tipsy so, probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah I, I completely agree it's not something I wanna get into on a regular basis.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Sure, uh, and obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so yeah I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great, um, fine so, at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story I think, um, you know, uh, I'm reassured.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: But the fact that I, I I think it's, um, probably just a simple what we'd say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, you know you haven't got any other symptoms that, suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain.\nDoctor: Um, would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so it's something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called Trimethoprim or, Nitrofurantoin which is a three day course.\nPatient: \nPatient: \nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: And normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab.\nPatient: \nDoctor: And see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Um, if you are having some pain, simple Paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me, and we can have another look again.\nPatient: OK, OK uh great. Um, with, with the urine sample, um, uh, how do I go about doing that, do you know? Is it through the app?\nDoctor: So if I'll give yeah no it's a well uh so yeah good question, so I will give you I will organise uh for you to come in, and drop off a sample at one of our practices, um which we can test there and then, at the urine and send it off to the lab uh we can back in touch with you with the results.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK perfect. Great.\nDoctor: OK, do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those give me a call, OK?\nPatient: Either back pain, vomiting, great OK. Yeah, I'll watch out for those.\nDoctor: All right, OK. Have a good day.

And I've just been feeling not so great. And\nPatient: It's all come from like, uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhoea. And it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it\nPatient: Yeah it doesn't feel very solid. It so, it just, it's just pouring straight from my bum, and like just coming out. And it's, uh,\nPatient: Yeah it's just uh not, not been very pleasant. And like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better. So\nDoctor: Wow, no. Sorry to hear. Seems like there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start, your symptoms?\nPatient: Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it\nPatient: So Monday, Tuesday, I I, so I think it was about three, it's been about three days now.\nDoctor: OK. And is it mainly diarrhoea? So, you mentioned watery stools. Um\nDoctor: How many times are you going a day, would you say?\nPatient: Um so I , I feel like it's like almost every hour, when I'm awake.\nPatient: Um, so . Sorry?\nDoctor: Alright, wow. OK.

Have you got any blood in your stools?\nPatient: Um\nPatient: So I, no I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no I , I think it's just I, nothing like that. There's nothing like that.\nDoctor: OK. And any, any tummy pain? Any, any, any pain in your tummy?\nPatient: Yeah. I mean I, it, I feel, I feel a cramp.\nPatient: and then, and then I know it's time to go right? So, around every hour I just feel something come up. And then I have to go. So, yeah I mean that's, that's the , kind of the first sign.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy?\nPatient: It's kind of, . If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um\nDoctor: . Well why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side?\nPatient: Um I I think it it , it feels pretty , like in the middle, to me. Not on any side, left or right.\nDoctor: OK. And does the pain come and go, or is it there constantly?\nPatient: Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes.\nDoctor: . Fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had, how bad is this pain?\nPatient: OK so like\nPatient: Um\nPatient: \nPatient: So\nPatient: What do you mean by, uh pain? So I, I think it's maybe a\nDoctor: Is it, is this pain as in making you double over? Is it ten, is it ten out of ten, the worst pain you ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten?\nPatient: I I guess so. I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and\nPatient: Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means. But maybe is that like a six, or a seven?\nDoctor: solid six. OK, OK. Alright, good. Um, and apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Um, yeah I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um\nPatient: Like I and, like I've have vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, yeah one time I just like had some milk, and I just completely vomited it.\nDoctor: Not sleeping. OK, alright. Uh\nPatient: Um, I've been, I've been trying to avoid it. But um, yeah.\nDoctor: And the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right?\nPatient: Um, sorry could you repeat that?\nDoctor: and the vomiting is not as, uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right?\nPatient: Uh no, no it's not.\nDoctor: OK. OK, alright. Um, any other symptoms, like fevers or temperatures?\nPatient: Um so I, yeah I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time. And uh I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading, or anything like that. But it's, I, yeah I've, I've sure I'm, I'm not a, like not a normal temperature.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK, so you're feeling hoarse. OK. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine OK?\nPatient: Um yeah a bit, I guess less frequently maybe. Um but yeah, it seems to be OK.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Um, fine. And, and you said that, you mentioned, three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else, um with diarrhea, for example?\nPatient: Um so I , so my um my brother has had, actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days, as well. Um and I I've, I'm not, yeah I I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But , yeah I, that's why\nDoctor: Is your, is your brother now better?\nPatient: Um\nPatient: He, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you, I can see you're drinking a coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down?\nPatient: Um so it just feels like the, the fluids do go down. But it just feels like it's going straight through.\nPatient: It just feels like it's going straight through.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? And which , which uh which you kept in?\nPatient: Um so, I had some, I mean I had some lunch today. Um\nPatient: But again it just it just came, come out pretty loose.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Um and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical history?\nPatient: Um, so I um, yeah I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um\nPatient: Yeah I mean I, I'm an OK weight. And um, I I can't think of any related medical history.\nPatient: Um, I mean like my, yeah I no I I don't think so.\nDoctor: Good.\nDoctor: I'll take it you don't take any regular medications, then.\nPatient: So I\nPatient: Um\nPatient: No I mean I, I've been taking some like Paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But uh, I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that.\nDoctor: OK. And do you have any allergies to any medications?\nPatient: Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of.\nDoctor: OK. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems?\nPatient: Um bowel, so would, would bowel like, is is the colon like something that\nDoctor: Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut. So it could be anything from the mouth anus.\nPatient: So my, yeah my, my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment.\nDoctor: Ohh dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he?\nPatient: So um, from what I heard he's kind of, So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer, and all that kind of thing. But um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, and yeah. So yeah it's, it's um, he's, yeah you can, yeah I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting him a lot. And um, that's it's quite, I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now.\nDoctor: Yeah, OK.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yeah I'll make a not of that 'cause uh, important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan?\nPatient: Um so, uh not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um sister and my mum.\nDoctor: OK. And, uh, how are things at home?\nPatient: Um, I think, I mean in what sense do you mean that?\nDoctor: Don't .\nDoctor: in general day-to-day life are you managing OK? Any particular ?\nPatient: \nPatient: I mean uh\nPatient: I think uh, yeah it's been, it's been tricky. Um\nPatient: Going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go, um when I can. So I I try and go um\nPatient: I think at, at home, uh yeah I just haven't really um\nPatient: I I don't normally actually um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So, I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um\nPatient: Yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so\nDoctor: Sure. you mentioned work. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work?\nPatient: Um\nPatient: So I work at a, I I work at um an office, um in Central London. Um it's uh, so I work in government.\nDoctor: , OK. So , OK right. And just a couple last final couple, uh couple questions. Uh, smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: Um so I I smoke um, I smoke uh, uh for like socially, but not like regularly. Um\nPatient: So normally if if it's a, a Friday or something like that I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um not .\nDoctor: \nPatient: Sorry?\nDoctor: And alcohol?\nPatient: So alcohol, um uh you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um . On Fridays I have more um alcohol um\nDoctor: \nDoctor: But not .\nPatient: But yeah uh, I'll have my units um\nDoctor: \nPatient: Uh, honest, I suppose um, not every week, but maybe I'll once or twice a month, that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um, yeah um\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Well thank you for me. That's really helpful to know. So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: bit of a basic infection of your tummy. . There's nothing to worry about. Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Just like you did for you brother. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? And you can\nPatient: Uh-huh.\nPatient: Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out. Um\nDoctor: Right.\nDoctor: fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth uh recommending that.\nPatient: Do i need like a prescription for that?\nDoctor: no, you can just get that over the counter.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK? But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK?\nPatient: OK. So you're saying that I should, I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids?\nDoctor: clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash. And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate.\nDoctor: Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK?\nPatient: OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like, um Paracetamol and things like that?\nDoctor: Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK? Try and avoid alcohol if you can.\nPatient: Uh, OK I'll try. Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Alright then.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Thank you for your help.\nPatient: Alright. Thank you very much.

And it really annoys me.\nDoctor: Ohh dear, OK. , when, when did it exactly start, this headache?\nPatient: Eh, around three days ago, maybe.\nDoctor: Three days ago, OK. And whereabout in your head, is this pain?\nPatient: Um, it's basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly, um, around my right eye. Um\nDoctor: , OK. Um, and is the, headache there all the time, or does it come and go?\nPatient: Um it's, it kind of comes and goes. Um but, I mean it is there all the time, but like sometimes it's stronger.\nDoctor: OK, so it comes and, fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, um, ten being the worst type of pain you ever had. How would you rate this headache?\nPatient: Ohh it's probably a eight.\nDoctor: Eight. And if I was to ask you describe the headache to me, um, in terms of the nature of the pain. Is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing?\nPatient: Um, it's kind of, it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it like, it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: And by the end of the day it was like pretty, pretty, like it was a lot, basically. And then I was thinking OK, maybe I'll just go to sleep. And when I woke up the next morning like, it was even, even worse basically. So\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: So, you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better?\nPatient: Um so I tried uh Ibuprofen. Um so I took, like a few. Um for the last two days, basically.\nDoctor: Did that help?\nPatient: But it doesn't really help, no. In in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But\nDoctor: OK, all right. And except for the headaches, any other symptoms at all?\nPatient: Um\nDoctor: So, example any, problems your eyesight or your vision?\nPatient: Not really, but just when it started, I I got this like weird shooting lights. And like now like light is quite annoying, my eyes.\nDoctor: So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights?\nPatient: Yeah, yeah. It hurts. So\nDoctor: , OK. And um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision?\nPatient: Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from, shooting lights .\nDoctor: Mmm, , OK. Any nausea or any vomiting?\nPatient: Um, well I'm like basically, I I'm sick with the headache. But I, no vomiting.\nDoctor: When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? OK. Yeah, no vomiting, OK. Any neck pain or neck stiffness?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK. And any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any difficulty , with weakness in your arms and legs?\nPatient: No, it's hard to focus though. So, I I had to take a couple of days off work, actually.\nDoctor: Ohh really? OK. OK, yeah probably, well I'll, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: OK. And have you had anything like this before in the past?\nPatient: Yeah I mean, headaches, you mean.\nDoctor: Or, uh, or similar, similar to, similar to this kind of headache, ?\nPatient: Yeah. I mean I had. But, usually after I I take uh Ibuprofen it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. .\nDoctor: not, OK. All right. Um, any temperatures, or fevers?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any rashes at all, on your skin?\nPatient: Mm, no not that I've noticed.\nDoctor: OK. And just moving forwards. Are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana?\nPatient: Am I what, sorry?\nDoctor: You fit and well? , do you have any other medical history?\nPatient: Yeah, I think so. It's just the headache.\nDoctor: Any history of migraines at all?\nPatient: Not myself, I've never had a migraine. But my sister and my mom have them quite frequently.\nDoctor: OK. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication?\nPatient: Uh, no no.\nDoctor: Are you on the pill?\nDoctor: OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications?\nPatient: Mm not that I know of.\nDoctor: OK. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Are they, is that normally well-controlled or are they um, having difficulty, controlling their symptoms?\nPatient: Um so my sister's, like better. Like it's kind of, it's very rare. But my mom's is like quite bad, um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that. It's, yeah.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm, OK.\nPatient: Takes her out for a few days, basically.\nDoctor: Ohh right, OK, fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life, outside of, um, outside of, work. So , who lives at home with you?\nPatient: Uh I live with housemates. So, three of them. So we're four .\nDoctor: OK. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this , impacting on your work.\nPatient: Yeah so I work, well I work in IT. So I work with computers a lot. So it kind of is difficult to focus. Um I had to like reduce the uh, brightness of my screen.\nDoctor: Mmm. OK. Do you wear glasses?\nPatient: Yes, I do.\nDoctor: Have you had any, uh, have you had any recent eye check, done? Eye test?\nPatient: No, uh I've been wearing them since I was five , five year old. So, it's quite a long time.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Something for you to bear in mind if you feel that you are, your eyes are straining. Um I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um, have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently?\nPatient: \nPatient: Well, it's been a bit stressful, kicking off a new project. But um, yeah nothing out of the ordinary, really.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Great. Um, regarding smoking or alcohol. Do you drink or smoke at all?\nPatient: I socially smoke. And I drink only socially.\nDoctor: But only socially?\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Right. Now um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online, or spoken to people?\nPatient: Um\nPatient: Not really. Um at first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water. Because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I I like get headaches. Um\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: But, I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried, it's, I don't want it to be a migraine. Because I know what it's like, from my mom and my sister.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Mmm.\nPatient: And it's really annoying. So I I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. Um but I don't know if that is the case. So, yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today?\nPatient: Yeah maybe just kinda, if you have any recommendations of that I can take something stronger. Because apparently, Ibuprofen doesn't help me. Uh\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Usually it gets resolved if I have headache in like, after like one or two days. But currently it, it didn't help me.\nDoctor: How many tablets did you take of Ibuprofen?\nPatient: Uh, three a day.\nDoctor: Three a day, OK. All right. Um, so uh, Adriana, so um, really what I think is going on here. I , uh, unfortunately I do think this could be, a headache very similar to a migraine.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also migraines. I think it's something for us to think about.\nDoctor: Um, now I'm not saying it's gonna, keep happening, but, it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers.\nDoctor: Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the Ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is, I'm not sure whether you're taking, the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets, three times a day.\nPatient: Ohh right.\nDoctor: So, so , there's definitely room for, improvement there. Or, I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Um, we can also add in other, painkillers like, Paracetamol, or Codeine. Which might be helpful as well.\nPatient: Mm, yeah. I think is what my mom takes for when she has um, um migraines.\nDoctor: OK. And I think it's , certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a , prescription for that today. Um, with regards to um, the next few days. It may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: And, and, you know I'd like you to come back and see me, in about uh, a week's time, week to two weeks' time.\nDoctor: If you are having , more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as, prophylactic. Which basically means, medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time.\nPatient: Mm, OK.\nDoctor: OK. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better, or they're getting worse. Um, you know, I want you to give me a call, or come back and see me sooner. OK?\nPatient: OK. Yeah.\nDoctor: So, if you're having any problems with your vision, or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well. Just give me a call, and come back and see me.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: All right?\nPatient: Great.\nDoctor: Great. Well, have a good day.\nPatient: Thank you. You too.

And um, April are you normally otherwise fit and well?\nPatient: Yeah, pretty much.\nPatient: Am I normally what?\nDoctor: Uh fit and well. So do you have any other medical history?\nPatient: Uh, well I have type two diabetes. And I have quite high blood pressure.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any, or what what medications do you take on a regular basis, if you don't mind saying?\nPatient: Um I take Metformin for the diabetes. And I take Lisinopril for the high blood pressure.\nDoctor: Yep.\nDoctor: Zinopril. OK, fine. Any allergies at all, to medications?\nPatient: No. No allergies.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: No, OK. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of?\nPatient: Uh my dad also has type two diabetes. But I think that's it.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, is there a doctor in a hospital, who looks after your diabetes?\nPatient: I just regularly go see a doctor.\nPatient: Um, that just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I, I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it, it's under control.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Right, excellent. And in terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you?\nPatient: Uh just, it's just me and my partner.\nDoctor: lives OK, um fine. Is your partner well at the moment?\nPatient: Yeah he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but, not uh, diarrhea, nothing, fine.\nDoctor: Right, OK. So he\nDoctor: Go away, he's got away with it, at the moment. OK. And uh, are you working at the moment, April?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, yeah I am working. But the, the first day I skipped. because I was feeling just too shit. Um, but then, I just felt like had to go back, 'cause I had so much to do. So I've been going in. But it's not been fun.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work?\nPatient: Uh, I am a developer.\nDoctor: Ohh, so you work in the IT field. OK. IT field. Right, OK. Uh\nPatient: yeah. Work in IT.\nPatient: not too active a job. Uh, yeah.\nDoctor: No. Has it been quite stressful recently?\nPatient: Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work that way. Um\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: The reason I ask is sometimes\nPatient: I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think it's related.\nDoctor: Sure. reason I ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed.\nDoctor: Um, do you smoke at all, April?\nPatient: I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now.\nDoctor: OK. Um and what about alcohol?\nPatient: I mean, yeah I, I don't think I drank that much. Like, I I don't really know how you count the units. So I guess like I don't drink more than like, like, let's say three evenings a week? And I rarely get like properly drunk, or anything.\nDoctor: And what is it that you drink?\nPatient: Wine, mostly.\nDoctor: The wine. How much do you drink on those nights?\nPatient: Uh, I'd say like maybe two or three glasses.\nDoctor: OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Something think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can.\nPatient: Yeah? I should cut down on it.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter\nDoctor: Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic.\nDoctor: I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days.\nPatient: What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in, in say four days?\nDoctor: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest.\nDoctor: Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol.\nDoctor: If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over.\nDoctor: And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um\nPatient: Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just\nDoctor: Yeah so I think you know , really I think it depends on you. it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can.\nDoctor: Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week.\nPatient: OK. OK. Thank you.\nDoctor: But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK?\nPatient: OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry.\nDoctor: No no no , nothing to worry about otherwise.\nPatient: OK. Alright. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: OK. Well, have a good day.

She describes the cough as dry, continuous, and frustrating, affecting her sleep. She denies any mucus production or fever. Apart from the cough and nasal congestion, she reports feeling tired. She also mentions muscle pain, especially in her arms and legs, and difficulty with exercise due to this pain. She has a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, for which she takes Metformin and Lisinopril, respectively. She reports no known allergies or family history relevant to her current symptoms. She lives with her partner, who is currently well. She works in the IT field as a developer and reports that her job is not excessively stressful. She smokes but has quit for six months and drinks wine occasionally.\n\n   Objective: Her vital signs were not recorded during this encounter. On physical examination, she appears tired and has generalized muscle pain. There was no fever noted, and her respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. She was dehydrated due to the lack of fluid intake associated with her symptoms.\n\n   Assessment: The patient likely has a viral upper respiratory infection based on her symptoms of cough, runny nose, muscle pain, and fatigue. Her history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure should be monitored.\n\n   Plan: Advise the patient to rest, stay hydrated, and take Paracetamol as needed for symptomatic relief. If her symptoms do not improve in two to three days, she should return for further evaluation. If she is still feeling feverish or her cough worsens, antibiotics may be considered. The patient should consider taking a day or two off work if her cough persists.

She reports the cough as dry and continuous, keeping her up at night, causing a sore throat but not severe enough to affect swallowing. The patient also experienced shivers despite being in bed and being next to a warm partner, suggesting possible feverishness. Additionally, she reported muscle pain and weakness, which worsened during physical activities such as pilates, making her feel lethargic. Apart from these symptoms, the patient denied any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea (resolved after a few days), skin rashes, or problems with her waterworks or joints.\n\nObjective: The patient's vital signs were not documented in this conversation. On physical examination, the patient appeared tired but was afebrile. There was no evidence of respiratory distress; however, the doctor did not perform a thorough lung examination to assess breath sounds. The patient's ear, nose, and throat examinations were unremarkable. Her blood pressure and pulse were not documented.\n\nAssessment: Based on the subjective and objective findings, it appears that April is experiencing a viral illness, most likely a upper respiratory tract infection (URI). The dry cough, runny nose, and possible feverishness support this diagnosis. The presence of muscle pain and weakness may be due to dehydration or secondary to the systemic effects of the URI.\n\nPlan:\n1. Encourage rest and increased fluid intake to stay hydrated.\n2. Advise over-the-counter Paracetamol for symptomatic relief.\n3. Monitor symptoms for improvement in the next 2-3 days. If the cough persists or worsens, advise the patient to return for a follow-up visit.\n4. Consider antibiotic treatment if the patient's symptoms do not improve and/or if she continues to feel feverish.\n5. Advise the patient to take a day or two off work if possible to rest and recover. Encourage her to return to work when she feels well enough.\n6. Discuss the potential harm of alcohol consumption, especially in relation to blood pressure and diabetes management, and advise moderate consumption as appropriate for her situation."}

Can you hear me?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Great, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm you name and your, um, age please?\nPatient: Uh yes. Um Laura Parkinson. And uh I'm forty five.\nDoctor: Forty five. Alright Laura, well how can I help you this afternoon?\nPatient: Uh yeah. So I have uh soreness in my fingers, my finger, like, the skin on my hands is kind of cracked.\nDoctor: OK. When, when did this all start?\nPatient: Um, a couple of months ago. I got it three, four months ago.\nDoctor: OK so it's been that long, has it? OK. And so you mentioned your , is it the skin on your hand, mainly that's dry?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yeah, I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness, like you know, in other parts, like my legs. But it's not, it's not very, it's not severe. It's just you know, I've always, you know, I don't hydrate very much. So\nDoctor: Right. OK.\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah. Like it's very, it's very bad in my hands.\nDoctor: OK. Can I ask why have you come to see me today? Uh is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah I mean, it's gotten to a point where, where it hurts a lot. And I can't really do my job. So, I thought I should probably get it checked out.\nDoctor: Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Um, which part of your hands are affected, mainly?\nPatient: Uh the palm. I don't get, yeah.\nDoctor: Um, OK alright. Um, have you any itchiness in your palms?\nPatient: Yeah, it's itchy. Not all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy.\nDoctor: OK. Any bleeding at all?\nPatient: Um um I don't, I mean, no I don't think so.\nDoctor: you scratch yourself, you scratching yourself often, and bleeding?\nPatient: Um, yeah I guess when I scratched it, yes it has bled sometimes but, yeah. Otherwise, it hasn't bled on its own.\nDoctor: OK. Um, fine. Uh\nDoctor: OK. Sorry, I'm writing notes as we go along. Um, and you mentioned that skin is quite cracked as well. Is that right?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: OK, alright. Um\nDoctor: , I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? what were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done, to bring your symptoms on?\nPatient: Uh, I mean I am a, I do work as a housekeeper. Um\nDoctor: \nPatient: And to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. So that could be related. Um, I switched jobs, uh four months ago. Uh\nDoctor: OK. OK.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: I've been working for, as a housekeeper for, for a while now, but um, that's the only thing I can think of.\nDoctor: Yeah, I think that might be quite important actually. I think there's definitely, maybe a correlation between the two.\nDoctor: Um, fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness. Is that, you mentioned in your legs as well?\nPatient: Yeah. Yeah but isn't, sorry.\nDoctor: Is that, is that something you've, you've had for a while now?\nPatient: Yeah. It's not really, it's not really major. Uh yeah it's just like literally grinding my legs.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Right, OK.\nPatient: trouble.\nDoctor: OK. I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions, if that's OK. With your symptoms, have you, have you had any other symptoms, such as fever, or temperatures?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any nausea, or any vomiting?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any problem with your bowels?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any problem with your urine, or waterworks?\nDoctor: \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Otherwise you feel well, do you? And yourself, your eating, drinking, your appetite is well-maintained?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK, alright. Fine. Um, in terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all?\nPatient: I have diabetes.\nDoctor: Do you know if that's type one or type two?\nPatient: Type two.\nDoctor: Diabetes, OK. Anything else?\nPatient: Um no.\nDoctor: Any skin problems?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Eczema, dermatitis, for exmaple?\nPatient: Not that I know of. No, I haven't been diagnosed.\nDoctor: No, OK. Which medications do you take?\nPatient: \nDoctor: Metformin, OK. Do you have any allergies, either to any medications or in general?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK. Family history-wise, is there anything I should be aware of?\nPatient: Diabetes and what?\nDoctor: Diabetes as well. OK. Again, any skin problems?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh no, not that I know of.\nDoctor: Any history of asthma, or bowel problems?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: No. OK, alright. Um\nDoctor: Fine. In terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper. Um are you, you're not always very good at wearing gloves.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, you've recently changed jobs. Which which kind of places do you work in? Is it mainly residential, or is it commercial?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: At a hotel. I have to do the whole thing like bedrooms, bathrooms, .\nDoctor: Hotel, OK.\nDoctor: OK. OK.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Do you think there might be a relationship between the two? Between the, kind of the products you're using, and your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I usually use those for bathrooms. But, yeah bedrooms and corridors not always.\nDoctor: OK. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently?\nPatient: Uh, yeah like the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work.\nDoctor: OK. Can I ask a couple questions? Do you smoke at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Do you drink much in the way of alcohol?\nPatient: pints a week.\nDoctor: Once a week?\nPatient: Uh, a couple of pints a week.\nDoctor: a week. OK so, very minimal, alcohol there. Um\nDoctor: have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter? Any creams?\nPatient: Yeah. I tried uh E forty five.\nDoctor: Any luck with that?\nDoctor: \nPatient: Yeah, no it didn't really do anything.\nDoctor: No, OK. Alright. Um\nPatient: I also tried an antihistamine, antihistamine. Uh but it didn't\nDoctor: . OK, alright.\nDoctor: Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think um, based on your story, I I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis. Which is very common in, particularly people in your in your in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. And sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin.\nDoctor: Um, so moving forward there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. And in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: \nPatient: \nDoctor: As well as some stronger emollients, um which you really need to kind of coat on, three four times a day, for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin.\nDoctor: \nPatient: \nDoctor: Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week, two weeks time, I really need you to come back and see me again. And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you.\nDoctor: \nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Is that all clear?\nPatient: Uh yeah, that sounds good.\nDoctor: Great. Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Um, where do I get the medicine from?\nDoctor: I'll I'll I'll do a prescription for you now, and send it over to your pharmacy.\nPatient: OK great. Yeah, uh so you said a couple of weeks, it should get better, right?\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: I think I think minimum couple of weeks. Uh ten days to fourteen days. Um and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, like if it's spreading, or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Great. Thank you Laura.

Good morning!\nPatient: \nDoctor: Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Mesa from Babylon.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Can you hear me OK?\nPatient: Yep. Can you find\nDoctor: Yeah, OK, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Um, before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please?\nPatient: Uh yeah, uh Jack Smith, uh thirty first October nineteen ninety.\nDoctor: That's perfect, thank you, John. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?\nPatient: I am, yes\nDoctor: OK, great. So, um, tell me what's been going on. You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing. Is that right?\nPatient: Yeah, so I just feel I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way.\nDoctor: Right, OK. How long has this been going on for?\nPatient: Uh about six weeks.\nDoctor: Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all?\nPatient: Um I had something maybe, about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn't anything as long as this.\nDoctor: Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?\nPatient: Um, I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Uh, uh, um, just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear?\nPatient: Uh just the left ear, yeah.\nDoctor: Alright, so your right ear is fine.\nPatient: It seems be yeah.\nDoctor: OK. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick.\nPatient: Mh-mm.\nDoctor: Um, that's been, on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh it's kind of on and off. Like some things trigger it as well. So, for example, if I'm watching TV or listen to music or something that'll solve the ringing in the ear.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, and, um, have you had any pain from the ear at all?\nPatient: Uh no my left ear.\nDoctor: OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No, OK. Um, have, have you been experiencing any fever?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, not specifically apart from the dizziness so much.\nDoctor: Right, OK. And, um, has your ear been itchy at all?\nPatient: \nDoctor: OK. Now, do you use cotton ball buds to try and clean out wax from your ears?\nPatient: Uh nah I'll do it.\nDoctor: No, OK. Well, you're right, you should, you shouldn't be doing that. Doesn't clean up wax, it pushes it back in. Alright, um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear.\nDoctor: 'K. I'm just exclude the simple things. Simple things might be wax. You know. Someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the eardrum, which can\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: lead to muffled hearing. Um, if that's the case, that that's something that's easy fixable. But, um, so we need to exclude that first.\nDoctor: and then after that, we can consider other potential possibilities. Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum.\nDoctor: So, um, what I think we could do is, um, maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. It's not an emergency.\nDoctor: It can be done within the next four, five days or so, OK? And then, um, what I'll do, I'll send a message to our admin team.\nDoctor: I'll ask them to slot you into the clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out\nDoctor: whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on, OK? Um, can I just double check, the dizziness that you've been getting, um, how severe is it?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's, it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like uh not, not proper room spinning or anything like that but just, just a little bit kind of off balance.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Right, right, OK. Have, have you had any chest pain with it?\nPatient: \nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. Any palpitations, heart beating fast?\nPatient: \nDoctor: OK, fine, alright. Um, so let's get your ear checked out. I think that will be the, the most sensible thing to do. And then after that, we can, we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we\nDoctor: It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear. But, we just need to exclude whether there's\nDoctor: physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case, OK? Um, but\nPatient: is that the sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing I've got in my ear, 'cause it seems .\nDoctor: The ringing that you got, that you've got, it's something called Tinnitus. OK? Um\nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: and Tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get Tinnitus and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things, and in fact\nDoctor: I'm glad that you've mentioned that. What I might do, in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to, uh, put\nDoctor: paste the link for a leaflet about Tinnitus, um, in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: OK. And often that, that, uh, awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options\nDoctor: um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, OK? So, um, I'm going to paste a link to that, um, and you can read about that and\nDoctor: what we'll do is we'll see you in about four, five days time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP\nDoctor: but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what, what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that OK?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Yeah it sounds great.\nDoctor: Alright, great. So, um, bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team, I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment. Ring them, and then they'll slot you in, OK?\nPatient: OK brilliant.\nDoctor: Alright. If there's any problem, any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, OK?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Alright then.

You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow.\nPatient: Yeah. Um, I just noticed this like about a week ago, or something? Um, have like a weird swelling on, on, on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. Uh,\nPatient: It's not painful at all, or like, I I feel fine. But it's just, just a bit, a bit weird, to see that.\nPatient: Um, it's, it's slightly warm. Um, and I, I, cannot feel like this, little bit fluid in inside, or, uh, um?\nDoctor: Sure.\nDoctor: Sure, sure. , and .\nPatient: So, I, I like to know what's going on with .\nDoctor: , and so, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow?\nPatient: Um, it's the, the left elbow.\nDoctor: Left elbow, OK. , and have you banged that elbow?

It feels a bit strange, a bit\nDoctor: Sure, OK. , and um, , in terms of your job, do you do anything physical?\nPatient: Not really. No, I just, you know sit at a desk. Um, yeah.\nDoctor: Right. OK. , and um, has this happened before?\nPatient: No, no I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any like history of, of seeing this. I don't remember .\nDoctor: Sure, OK. Uh, and can I um, can I just double-check? Has anyone in your family, got any, kind of rheumatology, diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus or anything like that?\nPatient: Um, no, well I, I do, well I think, I think I have something like uh, osteoarthritis. Um,\nPatient: Uh, uh, it sometimes kind of hurts, uh, my joints. But uh, in my family, I'm not sure.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: . No.\nDoctor: Sure. , so you know you said you think you've got , uh, osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that?

Um, and, do you have any other illnesses at all?\nPatient: Um,\nPatient: Well not, not really, no. Um, I'm, I'm allergic to, to peanuts. Um, but that's, that's pretty much all I uh, have to say about my medical history, yeah.\nDoctor: Right, OK. .\nDoctor: OK. Uh, are you, are, are you allergic to any medication?\nPatient: Uh, no. Not that I know of.\nDoctor: No.\nDoctor: Sure. , and um, do you um, are you on any medication on a regular basis?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: No, OK. And are you normally fit and well?

Well done that's , it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. Um, and um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow, now?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, sure.\nDoctor: OK, good, bear with me one second.\nDoctor: Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic, all right.\nDoctor: And then, just, bring it round to this side, , I can see other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers.\nDoctor: There's, , is it, is it hot, compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: It's a bit warm, yes.\nDoctor: It's a bit warmer. OK. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve? Is it, if you, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all?\nPatient: On the, on the tip of the elbow, it's, it's OK, just like, next to it like where the, the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah it feels weird.\nDoctor: OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, , on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body?\nPatient: Uh, no not really. I have skin really dry now.\nDoctor: , do you , do you suffer from eczema at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. Alright.\nDoctor: OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem\nDoctor: OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. , this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint.\nDoctor: Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K?\nPatient: Alright.\nDoctor: So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done.\nDoctor: And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies.\nPatient: \nDoctor: So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days. Um.\nPatient: K . O\nDoctor: From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days.\nDoctor: And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now,\nDoctor: It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment , with one of us as soon as possible.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: 'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK?\nPatient: do you, do you think it's something dangerous? Like something, like could I die from that, or is it, is it\nDoctor: No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. K? So, , this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Yeah, OK, I see.\nDoctor: It's nothing , sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK?\nPatient: Yeah that, that sounds good. Thank you.\nDoctor: All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?\nPatient: Um, well just yeah I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah it feels a bit better now . Uh, but yeah, no that's it. Thank you.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Um.\nDoctor: OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that , over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Sure. thanks. Bye.\nDoctor: All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you.\nDoctor: And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment.\nDoctor: Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, , after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK, yeah that sounds good. I, I'll do that. And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment.\nDoctor: Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So , look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK.\nPatient: \nPatient: Thank you. Alright. Sounds\nDoctor: All right then. Take care then, all the best.

I would like a GP to assess you. what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK?

But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: So, um, um, so, in answer to your question.

Um, but I've, I've also, I've been feeling a bit, like a bit tired at work.\nDoctor: OK. Sure.\nPatient: Haven't really been, like exercising has been a bit difficult, because I've been feeling tired.\nPatient: Um, and, , yeah performing, , performing daily activities has, has been a bit harder than usual.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: . OK, all right. , and um, how long has that been for? The tiredness and, you know, , not wanting to exercise and.\nPatient: Um, , only after, only for a couple of weeks or so.\nDoctor: Couple of weeks, OK. And then, and the last day or so that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side? And you've cough blood, OK, all right. Um, you said you felt a bit warm. , have you measured your temperature at all?\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Um, with the back of my, my hand, yes.\nDoctor: just with that, OK, fair enough, all right. Um, OK. And now, can I just ask? Um, do you smoke at all?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: OK. What do you work as?\nPatient: Um, I work in an office, just a, desk job.\nDoctor: OK, all right. And, um, do you live alone?\nPatient: Uh, yes.\nDoctor: Yeah. In a flat or a house?\nPatient: Flat.\nDoctor: OK. Do you have any pets?\nPatient: Cat.\nDoctor: A cat, OK. Um, uh, uh, are you on, any medication at all? Regular medication?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, yeah, um, , Methotrexate, Methotrexate, that's.\nDoctor: Methotrexate. OK. , what are you on that for?\nPatient: Um, I've, I've got SLE.\nDoctor: SLE, OK. Do you have any other , diagnoses? Any other illnesses at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medication?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any other allergies at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK. So, um, you're on, you're taking Methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had Methotrexate?\nPatient: Uh, this morning.\nDoctor: Ohh, you had it this morning. OK, ohh right, all right.\nPatient: \nPatient: \nDoctor: OK. Um , um, couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and um, get an idea of how, unwell you are.\nDoctor: OK. Um, the first thing I'd like to do, is to try and measure your pulse.\nDoctor: So, what, the way we're gonna do this, is that, if you're, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist.\nDoctor: . Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't.\nDoctor: But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse. It's just under the thumb. If you put two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse.\nPatient: I've got it.\nDoctor: You got it, OK. Are you sure?\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: All right. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to tell you when to start counting, and when to stop counting OK. So I'll just get my stopwatch up.\nDoctor: OK. So if you can, um, you've still got the pulse?\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: OK. So if you can start counting, now please.\nPatient: One, two, three.\nPatient: Five, six, , eight, , ten, .\nPatient: \nDoctor: If you can stop now, . That, I think that was about eleven or twelve. Um, so that would make your heart rate about, sixty six to seventy four, that's, that's OK, good.\nDoctor: Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, OK. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible.\nDoctor: But the next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger.\nDoctor: And then let me see how quickly the redness come back. OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now. My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. , just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it.\nDoctor: And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK.\nDoctor: So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see.\nPatient: \nPatient: You look like you've got very good circulation.\nPatient: \nDoctor: OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much.\nDoctor: The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like , to , try and have a look down your throat.\nDoctor: OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a , laptop?\nPatient: Phone.\nDoctor: A phone?\nPatient: rested it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go.\nDoctor: , sorry, say that again.\nPatient: Got it rested the laptop but I can.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK, , OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a . That's, fantastic. And say ah.\nPatient: Ah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent.\nPatient: Lovely.\nDoctor: OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not.\nPatient: No, they feel pretty normal to me.\nDoctor: . OK.\nPatient: I think.\nDoctor: All right. Um.\nDoctor: Now, um, uh, . Sorry, I've forgotten your name.\nPatient: Um, Doris.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection.\nDoctor: OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um.\nDoctor: Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest.\nDoctor: And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online.\nPatient: \nDoctor: You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable.\nDoctor: However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection.\nDoctor: And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently?\nPatient: \nPatient: No, no.\nDoctor: No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots?\nPatient: Not that I know of, no.\nDoctor: No, OK. Anyone in the family have that?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today.\nDoctor: OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure.\nDoctor: And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK.\nDoctor: You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first.\nDoctor: Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team.\nDoctor: And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today.\nDoctor: And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer.\nDoctor: Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, , concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem.\nDoctor: That's not usually how lung cancer is presented. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms.\nDoctor: Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: All right. , are you worried about lung cancer?\nPatient: Well you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're, gonna, die of lung cancer, so.\nDoctor: . Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry.\nPatient: Forty five.\nDoctor: Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer.\nPatient: That's good to know.\nDoctor: Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well.\nDoctor: It can lead to infection inside the body, , we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment.\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then.

Is that right?\nPatient: Sorry, say that .\nDoctor: How can I help you today?\nPatient: So, um, I've been experiencing very weird symptoms, over the past month or so.\nPatient: And I don't know what's causing them. I have googled it and, um, nothing's coming up, so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. So, tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having.\nPatient: So, it started with, feeling very tired, but for a couple of days, and then I get back to normal.\nDoctor: \nPatient: And then I started losing feeling, in my hands and arms. I get a weird sensation like, uh, I guess, pins and needles.\nDoctor: Right again, the connection's not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand. Is that right?\nPatient: And.\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct.\nDoctor: OK. Is that the right or left hand?\nPatient: My right hand.\nDoctor: Is it always the right?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. Um, we've lost video now, maybe is there a, a, a button you can press?\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Are you happy for us to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment.\nPatient: Yes, that's fine.\nDoctor: All right. Um, so, you've been having these pins and needles, and episodes of numbness, in the right hand. Is it just the hand, or does it go up the arm as well?\nPatient: Uh, the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but it only lasts few days and then goes back to normal. So, it's very weird.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, is there any involvement of your leg at all?\nPatient: Uh, my, colleague said, I'm walking slightly differently to normal.\nPatient: And again, it's only for three days, or three or four days.\nDoctor: OK. You, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: , so, what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening?\nPatient: Um, I generally feel tired, and weak.\nPatient: And, sometimes I feel nauseous, and I don't feel like I want to do anything.\nDoctor: Right, OK.\nDoctor: Um, and, um.\nDoctor: You know, , your colleague said you've, you've not been walking normally.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Do you feel anything different, on either side, in terms of your legs? Can , have you noticed anything different?\nPatient: Yeah, so, at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker.\nDoctor: Right, OK.\nDoctor: And.\nDoctor: You know you, the abnormal gait. Has that been present, outside of these episodes?\nPatient: No, it has not. So normally, I'm, fit and well actually.\nDoctor: Right, .\nDoctor: All right, OK. Um, and, these, these episodes. How often have they been happening?\nPatient: They have been getting more regular. So at the start, it would be maybe once a week, uh, to every once , once a month, but now it's getting uh, uh, a couple of times a day.\nDoctor: Right, OK. And, how long have these episodes been going on for? When, when did it all start? Was it a month ago?\nPatient: , probably a month and a half, maybe two months.\nDoctor: Right, OK.\nDoctor: OK. And, along with these symptoms, of the weakness and numbness. Do you have any other symptoms at the same time? Like swallowing, or difficulty speaking, or vision problems?\nPatient: So, recently I've noticed, I can't hold my cup of coffee.\nPatient: And when I, do drink coffee, it's slightly harder to drink.\nPatient: And that's only been in the last couple of days, I guess.\nDoctor: Right. Is that during these episodes, or outside of these episodes?\nPatient: Only during the episodes.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Do you have any difficulty swallowing at all?\nPatient: Not currently, no.\nDoctor: . During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing?\nPatient: I, I, I feel like there's something in my throat.\nDoctor: OK. What about, um, difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any, any issues with that at all?\nPatient: No, I can speak fine.\nDoctor: OK. And any visual problems during these episodes?\nPatient: I, I don't think so, but I wear glasses.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Now um, can I just ask? , has, uh, is there any history of stroke, or mini-strokes in your family?\nPatient: Uh, yes. My, father has had a, operation to the side of his neck, to reduce the risk of stroke.\nDoctor: Right, OK.\nDoctor: Um, and, uh, how about yourself? Have you had any history of, mini-strokes or anything like that, along those lines? I know you're quite young.\nPatient: No, so after my, dad had his operation, I was required to be checked, and my cholesterol , was fine.\nDoctor: Good, excellent. So you had a, a blood test done. And did they check for diabetes as well?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my, cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all OK.\nDoctor: Fantastic, OK. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. Are you on any medication?\nPatient: I take an aspirin, seventy five milligrams, once a day, but that's, because of something I read on the internet.\nDoctor: OK. So, so, why is that? Why do you take that?\nPatient: I think it's, meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack.\nDoctor: OK. Do, have you ever told a doctor before, your GP, that you're on Aspirin?\nPatient: Yes I took, I started to , taking it after my, father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me.\nDoctor: OK. Uh, and, has any GP ever spoken to you about, the risks of Aspirin, and whether you should be on it? Or have you not , told the , the GP in the past?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: You haven't, OK. Um, all right. Um. Now, um, in terms of your uh, your kind of social situation. Um, are you working at the moment?\nPatient: Yes, I am.\nDoctor: , what do you work as?\nPatient: Uh, I'm, uh, I'm actually a doctor.\nDoctor: You're a , a, a medical doctor?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. Uh, which, specialty are you in?\nPatient: I work in, uh, plastic surgery.\nDoctor: Plastic surgery, OK, great. And, um, do you, have any, um, allergies to any medication at all?\nPatient: I'm allergic to penicillin only.\nDoctor: OK. And, um, are you, um, living alone?\nPatient: No, I live with my wife.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, fantastic. Uh , do you smoke at all?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, that's fine. Now, obviously you're a, you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on?\nPatient: Uh, I've actually, got no idea.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, well the, the way you're describing these episodes. They make me concerned about, mini-strokes or TIAs, , transient ischemic attacks. Um.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And so, that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of um, stroke.\nDoctor: Um, even though you're quite young, I think um, it's something that we need to exclude. So, what I'm probably going to do, uh, in fact what I am going to do, is I'm going to, refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic.\nDoctor: Um, now just to double-check. Do you have the symptoms right now?\nPatient: No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment.\nDoctor: OK. So, so, what I'm gonna do, is I'm uh, I'm gonna refer you to a, a mini-stroke clinic, or a TIA clinic.\nDoctor: Um, I send that referral off now, and then you can attend them, they, they'll usually, call you in within the next one to two days, OK.\nDoctor: Because it's something relatively urgent. Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days , before the weekend. So, um, uh, basically the deadline should be, Thursday, Friday.\nDoctor: We're expecting you to be seen by the time, that's the kind of turnaround we're, we're looking at.\nDoctor: And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. Um, they'll be checking, they'll be doing a ultrasound of the, carotid arteries, like your, your father had. Um, and, they'll be doing a, maybe a, they might do a scan of your brain as well, to check if there's any signs of a bleed there.\nDoctor: But, um, they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame, in order to exclude whether, you have um, any illness. OK, whether you have got any kind of stroke or, mini-stroke.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: Now, if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged. Then um, you may need to attend A and E.\nDoctor: OK, because um, our presumptive, working diagnosis is, mini-stroke or TIA, OK.\nDoctor: And if, a mini-stroke is prolonged then uh, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So, we're not talking about waiting one or two days, we want you to go to hospital in that instance, as soon as possible, OK.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: Now if , things happen again, feel free to contact us, we can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over the phone. That's, that's, that's not a problem, you know, you, you've got easy access to us.\nDoctor: OK. So, um, this is the plan going forward. Um, I'm going to, um, do that referral.\nDoctor: You should hear back from the hospital, relatively soon.\nDoctor: The hospital, you can actually ring them, on um, uh, the PALS number, and then there's also the TIA clinic number.\nDoctor: I'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation, OK. So you'll have all the information you need, to chase this appointment.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And um, if you want, you can ring them, either today or tomorrow morning.\nDoctor: , today in the afternoon, wait uh, one or two hours. Or tomorrow morning just to find out when they got time to slot you in. And, just to make sure they've got you in the system, that they've got in the books, and they're going to be calling you in, OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: , this isn't, a, an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to A and E. But it's something quite urgent we need to, deal with in a short space of time, OK.\nDoctor: So if there's, if there's any delay that, transpires for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, they, you don't get called. , you, you get, get in contact back, back with us, OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: All right. Did you have any questions at all?\nPatient: No, I think that covers, most of it.\nDoctor: OK, great. So just bear with me a few minutes, and then I'll send that uh, all through and then you should, um, you should be able to help, you should have the information at your hands to, in order to take things further, OK.\nPatient: , thank you.\nDoctor: All the best.

So, when did this bee sting or bee bite occur?\nPatient: Um, it was, just a few minutes ago.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, and, your, your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but, do they, which. Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen?\nPatient: Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side. Um, and it, and it's just a bit sore, maybe it hasn't kind of , fully swollen up yet.\nDoctor: Sure.\nDoctor: Sure, OK. Uh, you said you've been having some difficulty breathing.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Your breathing seems all right to me right now. Um, the reason why I'm, clarifying is, because we have to decide whether this is a, an acute emergency. Whether I need to send you in to hospital straight away.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Or whether we, more time to ask questions, OK. So um, , do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak?\nPatient: Right.\nPatient: I, I, I , I don't, feel like it's , like particularly acute, but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I don't, I just wanted to speak to someone.\nDoctor: Sure, sure. .\nDoctor: Sure. No you, uh, you did the right thing and I, and I can understand it , it is quite anxiety provoking, OK. All right. Can I just double-check? Before we carry on asking other questions. Have you got history of anaphylaxis?\nPatient: Uh, not that I know of.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: No, OK. Have you ever been given an EpiPen?\nPatient: Uh, I haven't no.\nDoctor: No, OK, all right.\nDoctor: Let, let's, um, take a step back now. So, in terms of the bee sting, it was a . Did you see a bee or you're, you're just , um, assuming it was a bee?\nPatient: Um, I, , I, I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp, but um, , yeah it was one of the two.\nDoctor: . One of the two.\nDoctor: , OK. And, um, the area of your body that it stung. Where was it? Did you say it was your arm?\nPatient: Yeah, it was on my arm.\nDoctor: All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look?\nPatient: Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there.\nDoctor: OK, all right. That looks OK to me right now. , does it look red to you at the moment?\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, OK, all right. Um, now, is, is there any swelling, around that area, that you can see? I, I couldn't see any.\nPatient: Uh, .\nPatient: Not particularly. I, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy, uh, and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like, particularly swollen. Um.\nDoctor: Sure. OK, all right.Um, now, have you taken any medication? It's probably a , you probably haven't, 'cause it was a few minutes ago. But have you? Is . , not taken , any , antihistamines or anything like that?\nPatient: \nPatient: Not at the, not at the moment, no. Nothing, nothing yet.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. , now, um, if I can just go back. Do you have any history of any , any, kind of illnesses at all?\nPatient: Um, I've, I've had eczema before. Um.\nDoctor: OK, .\nPatient: , that's kind of the, the major thing, nothing, nothing really.\nDoctor: , OK. Have you, got a history of any allergies to anything?\nPatient: Uh, I'm allergic to penicillin.\nDoctor: All right, good. Um, and in your family, is there any history of any illnesses, or, any history of any kind of acute reactions?\nPatient: Um, not that I think is, particularly relevant, no. I don't have, I don't have any.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: \nDoctor: Right. , and, um, do you have allergies to any kind of, cats, or dogs, or pets, or anything like that?\nPatient: Uh, not that I know of, I've , yeah, I've been around dogs and cats, .\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yeah. , and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Um, can I ask? Do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or anything like that?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, uh, sometimes, occasionally.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Have you ever been on medication for that?\nPatient: Um, no.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Um, great. Now, um, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just, it's for, for general information purposes.\nDoctor: So, um, , are you working at the moment?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: What do you work as?\nPatient: Uh, I am a, uh, computer scientist.\nDoctor: OK. And, um, , you living alone?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. Do you have any pets at home?\nPatient: Um, I have a cat, at home.\nDoctor: A cat. OK, great.\nDoctor: What I'd like to do now. If that's OK John? Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK.\nDoctor: Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the.\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK?\nPatient: \nDoctor: Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time.\nPatient: Yup.\nPatient: Ah.\nDoctor: OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um.\nDoctor: Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, and your wrist.\nDoctor: Um, I don't feel that you're having , a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction.\nDoctor: Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that , immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary.\nDoctor: What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now.\nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: , but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for.\nDoctor: Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a , stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites.\nDoctor: And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away.\nDoctor: So, , we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example.\nDoctor: You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. .\nDoctor: Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction.\nDoctor: However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK.\nDoctor: What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines.\nDoctor: So you can buy them over the counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this.\nDoctor: Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and you, it feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection.\nDoctor: We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic.\nDoctor: And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, , action needs to be taken urgently.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Did you have any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Uh, no, I think, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that um, can I get the, uh, so the antihistamine from any shop, or like does it pharmacy?\nDoctor: Yeah, that's, that's over the, yeah , over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription.\nPatient: \nDoctor: OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a , a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, , non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK.\nDoctor: So uh, but , that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what symptoms are.\nPatient: Great.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: If those kind of things happen, get back to us.\nDoctor: If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for , having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down.\nPatient: OK, great. Yeah, that makes sense.\nDoctor: All right then John, OK. Uh, well we'll leave it like that, , come back to us if you have any further issues.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK. Thanks. I appreciate your time.\nDoctor: My pleasure. All right, take care then.

Have you been abroad anywhere recently?\nPatient: Yes, I have actually.\nDoctor: Where have you been?\nPatient: I went to Vietnam. Uh, I came back four weeks ago now.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, and, um, uh, did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there?\nPatient: I did, yes.\nDoctor: Which one did you take?\nPatient: Ooo, I can't remember now, off the top of my head.\nDoctor: Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet?\nPatient: I think it was daily.\nDoctor: OK, um, and was it one tablet or was it another one that you would take on top of the first one?\nPatient: I think it was, uh another one that I took on top of the first one.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And, and what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just seeing the cities or going through villages or hiking? What what kind of activities were you doing?\nPatient: It was quite really, 'cause we were there for a few weeks, and we toured to, uh, several different parts of the country, and uh, the countryside and some cities as well.\nDoctor: OK. Uh, and um, did you do any kind of, were you in rivers or things like that? Were you, you know, how adventurous were you?\nPatient: I'm sorry, could you repeat that? I missed that.\nDoctor: Where you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean how adventurous was your trip?\nPatient: Yes, it was quite adventurous. We were sort of trekking and, um, cycling, uh, through the farmland and, um, seeing how people lived in a day-to-day life in, in, in farmland.\nDoctor: Right, OK. Um, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, do you have, um, any other illnesses at all, in the past?\nPatient: Mmm, as I said I've, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any, uh, major illnesses in the past, I can think of.\nDoctor: And that back pain have you, um, have you seen anyone about that?\nPatient: Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that.\nDoctor: Have they, have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all?\nPatient: Um, they've said that it's, u,h related to long periods of time sitting at a desk, and just, uh, bad posture. So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and, and to strengthen the muscles in the back.\nDoctor: Alright um, are there any illnesses in your family at all?\nPatient: Hmm, the main one would be, um, heart attack. My, my father passed away of that.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Um, how old was he when that happened?\nPatient: in his sixties.\nPatient: Um, sixty eight, I think. Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Um, are you on any medication at all?\nPatient: Uh, just Seroxat.\nDoctor: OK. Uh, do you have any allergies at all? medication?\nPatient: No, I've just really pollen allergy. That's all I have.\nDoctor: OK, so hay fever.\nPatient: Yes, yeah, just hay fever.\nDoctor: Alright. Um, are you, um, you're working at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, I am, yes.\nDoctor: What do you work at?\nPatient: I work as a nurse.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Um, and, um, you're up to date with all the vaccinations, Hepatitis B, and that kind of thing?\nPatient: Yes, indeed. Yeah.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: But I'm, I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment. It's been quite difficult, feeling so, uh, tired all the time.\nDoctor: So, I can .\nDoctor: Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all?\nPatient: No, I'm not.\nDoctor: OK, and ohh do you drink much alcohol?\nPatient: Mmm, moderate alcohol intake. Yeah, I don't drink too much.\nDoctor: OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?\nPatient: I try and do, uh, some moderate physical exercise a few times a week.\nDoctor: OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um\nDoctor: What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics. Examine , and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection?\nDoctor: Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK?\nDoctor: Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And you've had exposure to rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests.\nDoctor: After you've been seen by somebody.\nDoctor: Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first.\nDoctor: You come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E.\nDoctor: I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception.\nDoctor: Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.\nDoctor: And inflammatory markers and things like those, technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about.\nDoctor: But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out. And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.\nPatient: OK. That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I, I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in.\nDoctor: And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there. OK?\nPatient: That's brilliant. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: Alright then, OK. Take care then.

Have you had this kind of pain before?\nPatient: Um, I mean uh, I've, had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before.\nDoctor: So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain?\nPatient: Um, not so much on the one side, it tends to be, a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. Um, but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which, I've never really had it, normally they kind of spread across the front of my head.\nDoctor: OK, all right. And, um, can I just double-check, do you have any neck stiffness at all?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: OK. And do you have any fever?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: All right. Um, how are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you, can you tolerate them all right, OK?\nPatient: Um, it, I'm a little bit sensitive it just, it kind of, makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle.\nDoctor: OK. And, can I just double-check, um, are you feeling nauseous at all?\nPatient: Um, not really, like . When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now, and I, seems to, be fine.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and um, can I just double-check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? They've been diagnosed with migraines?\nPatient: Uh, no. They haven't.\nDoctor: OK.

Um, but , it kind of, um, ebbs and flows every now and then, but, yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Do you have, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, or depression or stress in the past?\nPatient: Um, I've had, um, so I had, like anxiety for about, two years now, and I've been on, uh, Sertraline for, a while.\nDoctor: OK. Are you taking Sertraline at the moment?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and how do you feel in terms of , anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment?\nPatient: , no, not necessarily at work, sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. Um, but I, I kind of just, uh, the panic of not being able to get my work done on time.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, but other than that, I, I don't, feel, um, massively anxious.\nDoctor: OK, all right. Um, now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for , anyone suffering from anxiety. Do you have any , have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Good, I'm glad to hear that. Um, now, with regards to this headache. Is it worse when you lie down, or um, is, is, is it better when you lie down?\nPatient: Um, when I lay down, like, uh, it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, um and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Um, so yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again that's just kind of, um, soothes a little bit.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Um, so, would you say ultimately, it's better when you lie down? Or have you not ?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, I would say so.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and um, in terms of um, this, headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet?\nPatient: Um, I've taken some Paracetamol.\nDoctor: Has that helped?\nPatient: Um, not really, no.\nDoctor: OK. Taking anything else at all?\nPatient: No that's it, just Paracetamol.\nDoctor: OK. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all?\nPatient: Uh, none.\nDoctor: Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Have you ever had your blood pressure checked?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and are there any illnesses in your family?\nPatient: Um, no, there's nothing. My parents, uh, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well but, no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that.\nDoctor: OK, all right. And um, are you on any medication?\nPatient: Um, no, other, other than Sertraline and having taken, um, Paracetamol this morning, uh, nothing else.\nDoctor: Do you have any allergies to any medication?\nPatient: Not that I'm aware of, no.\nDoctor: All right. And, are you living by yourself at the moment, or living with someone else?\nPatient: Um, I live with my partner.\nDoctor: OK. Are you a smoker?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK. And, uh, do you have any pets at home?\nPatient: Uh, I have a cat.\nDoctor: OK. And, can I just double-check, how much exercise would you do normally a week?\nPatient: Um, so normally I, try to go running at least three times a week.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And what's your diet like?\nPatient: Um, it's OK, um, it's nothing, it's nothing um, really healthy, um, but it's fine.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: I wouldn't say unhealthy.\nDoctor: All right. Um, now um, in terms of this headache, uh, obviously I haven't been able to examine you, or see you directly.\nDoctor: But, um, it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: OK. That's one possibility. Um, and what makes that, more likely is the fact that, you've been under some pressure, and you have a history of anxiety in the past, OK. Um.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: The other possibility is, um, migraine as well.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and, the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side, and that you've got some sensitivity to light.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK, So, what, what I think we can do, is um, I think we can give you some, um, generic, pain relief.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: That would be the appropriate first step, for, migraine type headaches. OK. So I'll tell you what it is in a second.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And the other thing that I was gonna suggest is, we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work.\nDoctor: So, um, the medication-wise, the things that we'd start off first line, if someone had migraine was to, would be to start Ibuprofen.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And um, uh, that, the doses of Ibuprofen can be a bit, more than the normal doses Ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking Paracetamol as well if you like, but the, the Ibuprofen's um, actually more effective , for migraine.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, um, yeah, so the, the guidelines have changed, recently we used, we, before that we used to give Paracetamol as first line but now it's, um, Ibuprofen or Aspirin.\nPatient: Ohh right, O.\nDoctor: That's, thing. Um, the other thing I'd like you to do, is maybe consider taking some time off work. OK, because if the headache is due to stress from work.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore, counselling options as well so there's, a counselling service in your area, that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer.\nPatient: \nDoctor: I'd like you to, , OK I'd like you to try that. Um, what, we're gonna do is, we'll have a follow-up in a week's time.\nPatient: Yeah, that'd be.\nDoctor: As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do, is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. And you're drinking a minimum of, um, one point five to two litres uh, of water or fluids a day, and that's not including coffee or tea.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know uh, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well.

OK, so uh I, I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you, yeah?\nDoctor: Um, it it's not possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and I, I think you would need one quite urgently, OK? So the thing that's running in the back of my mind are um, kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um, sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Like , um the other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some dengue. But that would have, like you would have some, uh, blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Uh no. I mean I've got a bit of a rash, but nothing like, uh no, no, no, no bleeding.\nDoctor: OK. So where is the rash?\nPatient: Um, it's uh, the rash is kind of all over my body. Like it's not, it's not, it's not really localised.\nDoctor: How would you describe, how would you describe the rash?\nPatient: Um uh sort of red and itchy.\nDoctor: Red and itchy. OK. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh, yes.\nDoctor: It goes away. OK.\nDoctor: OK. So what we need to do, need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. OK? And um, after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital.

Let's put it that way.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um you know things like we have to rule out is Meningitis and all, but Ben, you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something Those are things when you think of Meningitis\nDoctor: But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash. While in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available.

You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so yeah is there any cough?\nPatient: \nPatient: Um, no, not really just, just\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: It's like when, when when I go into the lift, uh, it, it happens to be that, uh, I like, you know, my heart starts beating and I can't really breath, uh\nDoctor: Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces?\nPatient: \nPatient: No, it happens every time. It happens very significantly in, in the lift or when I'm, when I'm\nDoctor: So, how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Walk or run.\nDoctor: Walk, you start with walk. Do you feel short of breathlet's start this way, do you feel short of uh breath when you walk at all?\nPatient: No, actually not.\nDoctor: Right. You so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all.\nPatient: That's right, yes.\nDoctor: OK, so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift?\nPatient: Yeah, my heart starts beating. I, I feel like I can't breathe and, and, uh, it's, it's very difficult too.\nPatient: Uh yeah, two twenty nine. Uh, it's going, yeah just, just that you, you know, when, when you just feel unwell, and yeah, your heart starts beating.\nDoctor: described them like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat.\nPatient: Yep\nDoctor: Yeah, OK. You get any chest pains with it?\nPatient: Not really, no. It's just that\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK, no chest pains.\nPatient: I'm up.\nPatient: No chest pain.\nDoctor: OK. Alright. Fine. So, what we need to do, um, just before that, um, just a few more things. Uh, any any past medical history you'd like to share with me today?\nPatient: Uh, yes. I had too little activity of my thyroid, uh.\nDoctor: Sorry you had thyroid problems.\nPatient: Thyroid. Too little activity, yes.\nDoctor: Ohh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yep.\nPatient: Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and in, in\nPatient: In view of that, I took thyroxine.\nDoctor: Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? Are you using it every day?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, not anymore.\nDoctor: Why is that?\nPatient: Uh, I have, I have not been taking it in the last, actually since I changed doctor, I would say.\nDoctor: OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine?\nPatient: Ohh.\nPatient: That might be coinciding, I'm not sure about that.\nDoctor: When was your last blood test?\nPatient: Uh, haven't taken one in a long time.\nDoctor: OK, so you've not had a blood test.\nPatient: Mm hmm\nDoctor: Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: I think a general set of bloods is a good , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that, with vitamin levels, and your .\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: yes.\nPatient: No problem.\nDoctor: OK. And uh, now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. OK?\nPatient: Uh huh\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: We would need to then go in and do . But there's nothing from what your history you've said that, that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test, and then take it from there.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency. You need to go to A and E for that. OK? If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine, and you're not being sick. So if that's the case it's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us. OK?\nPatient: OK, I have, I haven't been walking lately at all. I haven't, yes. I haven't been walking lately at all so like, it's really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath.\nDoctor: Sorry? Could you repeat that?\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: Uh, just wanted to add that into , because, um, I haven't been walking. I haven't been feeling good enough for a good at all. So, yep.\nDoctor: OK. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. OK? But you know, if you have any chest pains, or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us.\nPatient: Thank you.\nPatient: \nPatient: I will, yes.\nDoctor: OK. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support. And I'll the form for you, but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah?\nPatient: Uh huh.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK. Can I\nPatient: I will. How do I call to report?\nDoctor: Ohh, there's a number on your app, yeah? If you open up your app there's the number on there. It's an oh three hundred number, yeah? So just call that number.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: I will find it, thank you.\nDoctor: Alright then.

So that's what we need to . Because to actually make you function a bit more, we'll start you on certain medications.\nDoctor: I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure.

Or can you just take them any time?\nDoctor: It doesn't really matter, you can take it, because sometimes, you know, you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up, so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything so might as well just take the tablets.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK, that's great.

Is that correct?\nPatient: Um, well.\nPatient: I think that's just, like, the first thing that I typed, but, uh, uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so, that was uh, um.\nPatient: I mean it's part of the problem but I would say that, more of a problem for me, is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like tingling in my fingertips.\nDoctor: OK, so numbness in the left arm, yeah? How long has it been going on for?\nPatient: Yes, yes.\nPatient: So, I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um\nDoctor: Mm hmm.\nPatient: It's probably been, I'd say, for at least two weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse. Like,in the beginning, I just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know a little bit in my elbow, and then in my arm, as well as in my hand\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: And now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better. Or, you know, try to take warm baths. It's not better, so I figured I'd call you and, and just figure out what's going on.\nDoctor: Right. So, have you mentioned that message and a warm bath, any medications that you've taken so far?\nPatient: Uh, well it's.\nPatient: You know it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked at stuff online, um, but you know I, I do take Ibuprofen because my muscles were sore, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class.\nDoctor: Uh huh.\nDoctor: \nPatient: So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness thing.\nDoctor: Mmm.\nDoctor: Sure.\nPatient: I'm just kind of getting a little worried.\nDoctor: Of course. So you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know, the tingling, numbness elbow . Not from your shoulder?\nPatient: \nPatient: And, um, well it's kind of funny, you know sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder. Like if I try to, if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of, a little bit of pain.\nPatient: Uh, but I would say, if i'm just like resting if I'm sitting like, right now, I can feel like it's numb, and I, I actually feel, tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some.\nDoctor: Yeah. So, which fingers do you feel numb?\nPatient: OK, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger.\nDoctor: Uh huh. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb, or both?\nPatient: No. It's, it's the, it's this side. So, the front side.\nDoctor: It's the front side. OK, right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to hold onto things, like a glass or something, have dropping it?\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed so, it's kind of hard for me to.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: So So you would say this in mind weakness, mind. So just to get my facts right. So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it. That's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you .\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: No, no, it's not hurting, it's not hurting, it's, like, numb, I can't feel it, right? Well, yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Fine. So, you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness, OK. Edward, any neck pain at all?\nPatient: Yes, absolutely.\nPatient: No, not, no, nothing .\nDoctor: neck pain and all? OK, right, OK. So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past, uh, medical history that you'd like to share?\nPatient: Mm hmm.\nPatient: Well, I guess because of this. You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold, like a month ago.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with, uh, friends, um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and\nPatient: We kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours, and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something.\nDoctor: what\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: So it's that. And then, I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago, is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye. Like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision\nPatient: Uh, and, but that, that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes?\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy. You know, I work out, uh, , and I, I don't really have any medical problems.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: Do you have any headaches at all, from the, in the recent past?\nPatient: Um, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches. You know sometimes I'll get kind of\nPatient: Tired but I think that's probably because I work too much. Or, you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue.\nPatient: Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really, fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness it's kind of like, hard to workout right?\nDoctor: Hmm.\nDoctor: Do you wear glasses at all, glasses, contact lenses?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, so no glasses . And, you've not experienced anything like a seizure or a fit, anything like that?\nPatient: What's a seizure?\nDoctor: Like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking.\nPatient: Ohh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that, mmm mmm.\nDoctor: OK, no fits, yeah, OK. And your weakness is only in your left arm. Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah?\nPatient: Right, exactly.\nPatient: Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah.\nDoctor: You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for?\nPatient: You know I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought ohh my God. It's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know virus thing, cold, and so I just kind of slacked it off. And then when I, uh, um, when I woke up it was gone.\nDoctor: Sure, OK. Um, OK. So is there any regular medications that you're using?\nPatient: Not really. I just take ibuprofen every once in a while, I take vitamin D. Um, I take some I, I like my my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, they're just like huge pills so I, I, most of the time I just forget.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: But, vitamin D I take. And then, sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep.\nDoctor: OK\nDoctor: Alright.\nDoctor: And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history?\nPatient: I know that my dad has I don't know if it it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nPatient: Um, and then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: And then, my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type two.\nPatient: She's got hypertension, um, she's got, gosh, what is it, ohh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her. Yeah.\nDoctor: Yeah, right. Any neurological conditions in the family?\nPatient: Uh.\nDoctor: there are related conditions. No, OK, that's fine.\nPatient: \nPatient: \nDoctor: OK, so, right. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here.\nDoctor: OK, few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So, and that with the weakness of the arms, make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: \nPatient: \nPatient: What do you think may be going on?\nDoctor: sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have, um, visual problems, like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. OK?\nPatient: Ohh!\nPatient: Ohh my God! Will I be in a wheelchair?\nDoctor: We, if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it. OK? I'm not, obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that, whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be, uh, dealt with here.\nDoctor: Yeah. So, what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello?\nPatient: K, OK.\nPatient: OK\nPatient: I see. Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.\nDoctor: I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, um, but I'm, I think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Alright. Yeah, that makes sense.\nDoctor: OK. Any questions at all?\nPatient: Well, what's, OK, so you're gonna do the referral, um, should I be taking any drugs or, um\nDoctor: No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, uh, when you have an acute you know, acute reaction or things like that. But, saying that, first we need to firm diagnosis.\nDoctor: Yeah. While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, uh, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E.\nPatient: Mm hmm, yes, OK.\nPatient: OK, got it.\nDoctor: Alright.\nPatient: Sounds good! OK, thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: Yeah. I'm I'm sorry. I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but, you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. OK?\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time.\nDoctor: That's OK.

{"id": 35, "prompt": "Below is a conversation between a doctor and a patient.\n\nTranscript:\nPatient: Hello.\nDoctor: Hello, hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello.\nPatient: Nice to meet you.\nDoctor: Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please?\nPatient: Michael John .\nDoctor: And your date of birth?\nPatient: Oh nine two nine eighty-three.\nDoctor: OK, and your address for me please.\nPatient: Two three one, Leonard, London street uh, sorry, London.\nDoctor: OK and that's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK, uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please.\nPatient: Uh, it's been happening for about, three days now? Um, yeah it, started off uh, was, I don't know it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: \nPatient: I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but, uh nothing funky in my diet and no travels recently, um and it just kinda kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do .\nDoctor: Mmm.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy anything ? No.\nPatient: No, no no no, just a little bit, yeah I I don't know I mean it's pretty standard diarrhoea, where it's was like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once, that was a little worrying, uh.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Repeat that please, that wasn't clear. What did you say?\nPatient: I threw up once, yeah.\nDoctor: After that we'd said something.\nPatient: Uh, nothing else was worrisome.\nDoctor: OK, right, and with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet?\nPatient: Uh, four to five.\nDoctor: Four to five times, yeah. And is there any? And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose?\nPatient: Uh, what do you mean?\nDoctor: Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know bit, bit of solid stools, bit loose kind of thing?\nPatient: It probably depends on the time of day to be honest, .\nDoctor: Sure OK. Bit of both and is there any blood or mucus?\nPatient: No blood. What do you mean mucus?\nDoctor: It's like the snotty stuff.\nPatient: In the stool?\nDoctor: Yeah, it looks like snot .\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No, so no mucus, OK. Any fever at all?\nPatient: Uh, maybe a little bit, but.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: It hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying.\nDoctor: Are you still able to eat, and drink?\nPatient: Uh, a little bit of.\nPatient: Appetite loss I guess worse than normal, but also not something I've, like I, if that was alone I wouldn't have, reached out.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Sure. So but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah? You're drinking plenty.\nPatient: Yeah yeah yeah.\nDoctor: OK. Excellent.\nPatient: Mostly it's been dry and red.\nDoctor: OK, and, um, what have you take, have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea?\nPatient: Nothing yet.\nDoctor: Nothing yet, OK. Anything for the abdominal pain?\nPatient: Uh, nothing yet.\nDoctor: OK. Right, and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history, is there anything you'd like to say?\nPatient: Uh, I.\nPatient: Probably I I had asthma.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: Um or, or I don't know I guess I still have it.\nDoctor: OK and uh, are you, any, uh, anything else other than asthma?\nPatient: Uh, my dad had hypertension.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Has hypertension. Had hypertension. Yeah he died of bowel cancer ten years ago.\nDoctor: Yeah .\nDoctor: Ohh dear, OK. Bowel cancer. Ten years ago. And how old was he when he died?\nPatient: Uh, sixty-two.\nDoctor: K, and um, you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Which ones?\nPatient: Lexapro.\nDoctor: Sorry?\nPatient: Lexapro.\nDoctor: Laxepro.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK, not heard of it may. Is it like Salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour?\nPatient: Yellow.\nDoctor: Yellow, OK. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Laxepro.\nDoctor: OK. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using?\nDoctor: Over the counter, anything at all?\nDoctor: OK. Right. Any allergies?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: Nothing, yeah, nothing.\nDoctor: No allergies at all, righty . Fine so, obviously, you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign, OK? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day.\nDoctor: That means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through, OK? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids.\nPatient: Mmm.\nDoctor: OK, when you go to the toilet. Um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having the diarrhea. Go, sorry?\nPatient: Soft .\nPatient: What is a soft diet? What does that ? Like, outside of, not those things, what do you mean by soft?\nDoctor: OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we are good give babies yeah. When they start eating you give, simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash.\nDoctor: Once you're OK with that for about forty-eight hours then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again, all right?\nPatient: \nPatient: What do you mean OK with that diet, like once?\nDoctor: Forty-eight hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that .\nPatient: OK, if if the diarrhoea is getting better but isn't getting, or do you want it to go away completely at that point, or if it's like trending upwards?\nDoctor: No, no, no preferably just don't because, what why do we say this? It's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food.\nDoctor: While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Yeah? So, um, at the same time you could have some, although you can't milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it help to build up the normal, um gut, gut bacteria back.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So those kinda, now, things to look out for, if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time, or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample, because that means you you may have , um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are, having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens you get in touch with us again, all right?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Any questions? You look a bit confused.\nPatient: No, that's it.\nDoctor: Yeah? OK and also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So, it helps to uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK? If you're a bit confused you know you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if, you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes.\nPatient: Perfect, that's great.\nDoctor: Is that OK?\nDoctor: All right then, you take care.\nPatient: Bye.\nDoctor: Bye now, bye bye.\n\nGenerate a SOAP note from this conversation.", "reference": "Subjective: The patient, Michael John, presented with a complaint of diarrhea for the past 3 days.

When it started, and how you're feeling at the moment?\nPatient: Sure, um, it's been ongoing for, a couple of hours now.\nPatient: Um, I'd say that it's come on, quite suddenly. I was, digging in the garden.\nPatient: And it, if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my chest.\nPatient: And it's more, it feels like it's pressure, discomfort, than more, than a pain.\nPatient: Um, if I, had to .\nPatient: If I, if I had to describe what discomfort feeling, it's, it's like someone's sitting on my chest. .\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Great. So, you've talked about your chest. Are you still in, discomfort at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, yes I do smoke, yeah.\nDoctor: OK, and when it started, how would you rate it out, out of ten?\nPatient: Say about, say, seven out of ten.\nDoctor: OK, .\nPatient: Ten being, very sort of, unbearable and severe pain.

So, are you normally OK to garden as you would?\nPatient: Uh, yes.\nDoctor: Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems?\nPatient: Um, high cholesterol, and, I've had hypertension, hypertension.\nDoctor: OK, so that's high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that?\nPatient: \nPatient: No, I don't take any medicine.\nDoctor: OK, and are you allergic to anything?\nPatient: Uh, .\nDoctor: OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten.\nPatient: \nDoctor: And it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yes, that's great.\nDoctor: And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing?\nPatient: Uh, yes I have. Um, I've got shortness of breath. And I feel slightly, light-headed.\nDoctor: OK, and is that getting worse or better?\nPatient: Um, it's remained the same. Although, I would say recently I've noticed, in terms of sort of breathing, I've had, some difficulty climbing the stairs. And, if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well.\nDoctor: And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain?\nPatient: Um, no pain as such, but there's often calf pain and, leg swellings.\nDoctor: OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct?\nPatient: That is correct, yes.\nDoctor: . So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart.\nDoctor: So, While to you, I will ring an ambulance. Who, should come to your address.\nPatient: Ohh, OK.\nPatient: Ohh right.\nDoctor: But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK?\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Um, should I, be concerned about anything?\nDoctor: It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else.\nPatient: , OK, .\nDoctor: , and we, and we need to look after your heart before anything else.\nDoctor: So, apart from this light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual?\nPatient: Um, nothing, else unusual. Um, I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea?\nPatient: I've noticed nausea, but no vomiting, yet.\nDoctor: Did you have anything to eat or drink this morning?\nPatient: Um, no.\nDoctor: And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment?\nPatient: I have, yeah. I am, yeah.\nDoctor: So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, apologies for not letting you talk very much.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: No, that's fine.\nDoctor: Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head?\nPatient: Uh, not to my head, no.\nDoctor: And how about to your left, or right arm?\nPatient: Uh, yes. There is some pain in my left shoulder and arm.\nDoctor: And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: And, have you noticed any problems swallowing, or drinking water?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: Good.\nDoctor: And have you noticed any problems going to the loo?\nPatient: Uh, no problems going to the loo.\nDoctor: And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Yes, however, there's some problems just, performing daily activities. Um, like I said, with the difficulties climbing up the stairs and going uphill. Um, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, yes.\nDoctor: OK. I would suggest, if she's there, you let her know that, you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So, she might need to get your things together.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Got it, OK.\nDoctor: The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm, and have some water if you need to.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Don't take any of those medications.\nPatient: Right.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And the paramedics should be with you, very shortly.\nPatient: All right.\nDoctor: So, when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: The one is your chest, so, your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs.\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So, they will give you lots of things to breathe through, and attach things to your arms. Just to check, things like your blood pressure, and your heart rate. So, don't be worried.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant, pretty, pretty much immediately.\nPatient: Yeah, .\nDoctor: \nPatient: Reassuring, I'm getting .\nDoctor: Sure. So, I will let the paramedics do their job. And when, you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes, to let me know how everything's going.\nPatient: Ohh, that's great.\nDoctor: Great.

Do you have any questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, no questions. I'll just await the ambulance.\nDoctor: Great, thank you very much.\nPatient: No problems.

Uh.\nPatient: Uh, I kind of, feel like, uh, it's, it's hard 'cause I, I , kinda lose my appetite.\nPatient: Also. Uh, one thing that's kinda weird is, I just sometimes also get like some, tingling in my arms.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: . And, like, especially if, for example when I, come into the elevator, in the morning.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: I, I can uh, of have, my heart is beating, kinda fast.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: So, those are lots of things. Are they all happening at the same time?\nPatient: Almost randomly like. Yeah, it's, it's, it's at different , times.\nDoctor: And, do they all happen at the same time? Or is it one thing one time, and one ?\nPatient: , one time, one thing at a time.\nDoctor: OK. So, let's start with the headaches. When they do come, do you have any idea the headache is going to come?\nPatient: \nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, not really but, generally during, work times.\nDoctor: So, it's normally at work?\nPatient: I'm at work, I'm in a meeting, or on my laptop.\nDoctor: OK. And, where does the headache sit in your head? Is it the front, or the back?\nPatient: Um, I can't say, so like, kind of over.\nDoctor: . OK. And, does it else?\nPatient: \nPatient: \nDoctor: Does it go anywhere else?\nPatient: , the headache? No, it's mostly in the front, and then yeah, it just kind of stays there.\nDoctor: And, when you have the headaches, specifically, do you feel sick?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: , not, not, not really, but it's like, making it hard. I, yeah, I kind of feel a little bit nauseous maybe. Um.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And sometimes I also feel like.\nPatient: Uh, yeah. It's like uh, maybe, probably, breathing or something.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And, do you normally get headaches, before all of this started?\nPatient: Uh, so.\nPatient: No, I, I feel like my, like, health situation was mostly under control.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: And then let's.\nPatient: But it , it started roughly when I changed jobs.\nDoctor: OK. So, talk to me about your job, what do you do?\nPatient: I'm a lawyer.\nDoctor: And, do you work in London at the moment?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: So, do you get these headaches on your commute in to work?\nPatient: Not really. I get it, mostly when I'm, at work.\nDoctor: OK, and tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time? Or do you speak to people?\nPatient: Like fifty-fifty. I go to meetings and then uh, sit in front of a computer.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: There's a lot of reading.\nDoctor: And, these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: , yeah, it happens then, yeah.\nDoctor: OK, and tell me, what did you do, before being a lawyer?\nPatient: Uh, no, I was a lawyer at previous job as well.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: \nDoctor: So, talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If, uh, ten out of ten is, extremely stressful, and one out of ten is being on vacation. Where would moment?\nPatient: \nPatient: Think it's, seven, or eight.\nDoctor: And, is that normal for you?\nPatient: Yeah, it's like, a law firm, like, there's always pressure.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: So, you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite. So, you don't want to eat as much.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Have you lost weight?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Can you remember how much you've lost?\nPatient: Five pounds.\nDoctor: And, is that because you're going to the gym? Or is that unintentional?\nPatient: It's not intentional, no.\nDoctor: OK. So, have you noticed your clothes feeling looser?\nPatient: , not really, ah, no.\nDoctor: And, have people said, or commented that you've lost weight?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Great. And, another thing that you also mentioned. Is that you noticed tingling in your hand.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: So, talk to me about that. Is it in one hand? Or both hands?\nPatient: Both.\nDoctor: And, do you get that in your legs as well?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And, what does it feel like, the tingling?\nPatient: Quick picking, yeah.\nDoctor: And again, is this the first time you've noticed this?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And the other two things that I've just, jotted down. Is, you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that.\nDoctor: Is that correct?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, but like.\nPatient: I would say like, I get this like, feeling of, short, like, , short of breath, sometimes.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: So, like, that could be what, you we're, referring to.\nDoctor: Yes. So, do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk?\nPatient: Yeah, no. Yes. Sorry, yeah.\nDoctor: . OK. And, how about when you're exercising?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And the last thing is. You mentioned that you noticed your heart beating?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Again, how often do you get that?\nPatient: I, I, when I like, it's maybe once a day, uh, maybe more. Uh.\nPatient: There's one more thing that I, I think I should mention, like, I do have like, some loss of libido at home.\nDoctor: OK. How long has that been happening for?\nPatient: Same amount of time really, like, since I changed my job.\nDoctor: Fine. And, apart from all of these things that you've told me. Do you have any other medical problems?\nPatient: Uh, well I have, hyperthyroidism.\nDoctor: OK. And, do you take medications for that?\nPatient: Thyroxine.\nDoctor: And, are you remembering to take your medications?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. And, do you drink or smoke?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: How much do you drink?\nPatient: Like, once a week, couple of glasses, of wine.\nDoctor: OK.

So, you've never taken cocaine, or marijuana?\nPatient: . No.\nDoctor: OK, thank you. And, are you allergic to anything?\nPatient: \nDoctor: Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: We can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Make sure that those things are functioning correctly.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: And probably do some blood tests, for your thyroxine.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: And take it from there. How does that sound?\nPatient: That sounds, uh, very good. Thank you.\nDoctor: I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person.\nPatient: OK. .\nDoctor: So, what we're going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and see us clinic, and see one of my colleagues.\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said.\nPatient: Thank you.\nDoctor: Great.

Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that?\nPatient: Yeah. I was watching TV and, um, just like over the last hour, I've started to feel, like, a bit short of breath.\nDoctor: That is, while you're sitting watching TV?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. And, have you noticed anything like this before?\nPatient: Um, no.\nDoctor: OK. And, apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else?\nPatient: Um, so, I , I started with a cough yesterday.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Yeah. I, I don't know if it's, um, relevant, but I had a C-section a few weeks ago.\nDoctor: OK. And, how long ago was that? Just a few weeks?\nPatient: Yeah, four weeks.\nDoctor: OK.

I feel like I'm getting really stressed out because, like, my heart, it's really going.\nDoctor: OK.

My chest feels sore, but so does my C-section scar. You know, it's, it's all tender.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And, since your C-section, did you have to take any medications?\nPatient: Um, no. Just some painkillers.\nDoctor: All right. And, can you remember what the name of those were?\nPatient: Uh, they gave me some, uh, Codeine.\nDoctor: And, have you had to use that regularly?\nPatient: Uh, yeah. I, I've been taking that fairly, fairly regularly. But, probably haven't taken it for a week.\nDoctor: OK.

And, I'll tell you when to stop. Is that OK?\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: So, we'll start in three, two, one. Go.\nDoctor: Great. That should be enough. How many did you count?\nPatient: Uh, I counted thirty.\nDoctor: Good.\nDoctor: So, your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Given that you've had a C-section, and you're short of breath, which has come on quite recently and quite quickly\nDoctor: It might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So, there's two ways of us doing this. The first is, I can call an ambulance. Or, you can take yourself to the hospital with baby.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Which one would you prefer?\nPatient: Uh, it feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance. Um, I, I will, I will go. I will, I will take myself.\nDoctor: Sure. And, what I would suggest is, go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, if you're taking any medications like Codeine, don't, don't take them for the time being.\nPatient: Mm-hmm, OK.\nDoctor: Is anyone else with you at home?\nPatient: Uh, no. My partner's at work.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: So, I think that's the best thing to do, for the time being.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: So, what I'm worried about at the moment is, given that you've had a C-section\nDoctor: Some people can suffer with clots. And, those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: It's quite a common thing to happen. And, it's not something to worry about. But, needs to be checked out in the hospital first.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, if it, if that does become the case, they can give you something to reduce the clot.\nPatient: All right, OK. That makes sense.\nDoctor: Fairly quick process.\nPatient: OK. Yeah. I mean, my mum's had, uh, clots in her legs before. So, I guess, you know.\nPatient: Yeah, that makes sense. I know, I know what they are.\nDoctor: Good. Are you, uh, are you particularly worried about anything, or do you want to ask me anything, before we go?\nPatient: No, no. I'm fine.

The patient should expect the consultation with her GP to last around ten minutes.", "generated": "Subjective: The patient, Tina Smith (DOB: 01/01/1982), presented with symptoms of wheezing that started two days ago after cleaning the house and suspects an allergy to dust. She described the onset as gradual, worsening at night, and affecting her ability to complete sentences while talking. She reported feeling short of breath and experiencing some discomfort but no pain or dizziness. She mentioned a history of asthma in childhood and occasional hay fever during summer, without regular medication use for either condition.\n\nObjective: Vital signs were not documented during the virtual consultation. The patient's voice, speech patterns, and overall demeanor suggested no distress or significant respiratory compromise. No physical examination was performed during the conversation.\n\nAssessment: The patient presents with symptoms of possible asthma exacerbation or allergic reaction. Given her history of asthma in childhood, current wheezing, and recent exposure to dust, it is reasonable to suspect an asthma attack triggered by an allergen. However, due to the progressive nature of the symptoms and worsening at night, the possibility of another respiratory condition cannot be ruled out without further investigation.\n\nPlan: The patient will visit a clinic for further testing, including oxygen saturation monitoring and possibly lung function tests. In the interim, she was advised to take an antihistamine if available or obtain one on her way to the doctor's surgery. A letter will be provided through the app for follow-up with her GP, who may prescribe additional medications such as steroids if necessary. The appointment with the GP should take approximately ten minutes. The patient was informed about the estimated cost of an antihistamine (4-6 pounds). No other specific instructions or follow-up appointments were given during this conversation."}

So this uh, kind of like uh, what is happening to me.\nDoctor: OK.

So, you've, you've had the diarrhoea for three days, and now you're having pain and vomiting.\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yes, yes, .\nDoctor: Was the diarrhoea been getting better or worse?\nPatient: Uh, uh, I , I think it, it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like uh, uh, like, middle, like normal, like uh, it, it, it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. And how often do you go to the toilet?\nPatient: I go, I need to go, I, I can't go to work because I need to go like every. I don't is this feeling like I go to the toilet, and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And, and uh, and, yeah. So, I need to be like close to the toilet uh, all the time.\nDoctor: That must be, that must be hard.\nPatient: Yeah, yeah, it's.\nDoctor: Have you had to drink more water than normal?\nPatient: I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water, yeah. I drink uh, I think I, yeah I don't know. I, I think I don't drink enough water.\nDoctor: An important question, have you noticed any blood?\nPatient: Uh, no, I haven't noticed any, any blood.\nDoctor: And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere?\nPatient: So, , the pain is mainly uh, focus in, in the centre area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And, uh, yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach, uh, like, it comes, uh, yeah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yep.\nDoctor: OK. You've been able to eat and drink?\nPatient: Uh, yes, but, yes but I, I go to the toilet also often. So I, I, I, yeah I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah I just, going to the toilet every, ten minute.\nDoctor: Hmm. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else?\nPatient: No, no, just there, and it, it seems to be alleviate a bit, toilet, and maybe it's like trapped gas. So, I don't know what it is, but.\nDoctor: OK. And when was the last time you vomited?\nPatient: I think it was this morning. This morning, I, but the, the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now. So, I, I haven't vomited again.\nDoctor: Did you have any breakfast?\nPatient: Right, I don't know.\nPatient: I didn't. Uh, no sorry, yes I did actually, I did. Pardon, I had some fruit, I had some fruit.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. And , and you vomited that up, afterwards?\nPatient: And afterwards, I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea, and I vomited, and then, uh, yeah and that was it, and that was it. And I have any today, and so now I'm, uh, I think I'm OK, but uh, yeah, and I don't, yeah.\nDoctor: Did you notice any blood when you vomit?\nPatient: Hmm. I think I do, I think I do, but is uh, uh, no, no actually I can't say sorry, I'm sorry. I, I, I don't think there is blood because uh, yeah it was, it was the strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So, so, yeah, it wasn't blood.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. And, um, did you eat anything that you think might of been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain?\nPatient: Yeah, .\nPatient: Uh, I, I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. And, but my inhaler kind of um, run out the one. Because you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have uh, this brand, but I bought a new one here.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: . OK.\nPatient: And, uh, I don't know maybe this new one has cause it, this, this problem. I don't know.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain, like this. Normally, it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off, and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double-check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing?\nPatient: Mmm.\nPatient: Uh-huh.\nPatient: Um, uh, I, I always have problems with my breathing, because of the asthma like, . When I, , I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. And how about chest, have you noticed any chest pain?\nPatient: , no, I haven't , I haven't noticed any chest pain.\nDoctor: OK. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both OK?\nPatient: Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes, yes. Uh, I, I, but uh, but yeah I don't walk very far because uh, I, yeah I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then. So, I'm spending some time at home.\nDoctor: Yep. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain?\nPatient: Ohh, it does a little bit.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Sorry, I was just writing some things down.\nPatient: Sure.\nDoctor: So, what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad, and it's causing your tummy pain. And it's , this is normally called gastroenteritis, so, an infection of the tummy.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Ohh, OK.\nDoctor: Normally, when patients have this do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so, if you start getting a temperature then you need .\nPatient: \nPatient: Mmm, OK.\nPatient: Uh-huh.\nDoctor: And please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better.\nPatient: OK. OK, I, yeah.\nDoctor: And normally,\nDoctor: Normally, things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse.\nPatient: OK. I didn't, yeah, sorry I didn't. No, I was saying I didn't have any, fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit the last four days, but I, I. Not sure if, if I had bit of fever, but very, little or, or, I'm, I'm but I don't think so, I don't think. I don't know maybe.\nDoctor: So, that's.\nDoctor: Go ahead.\nDoctor: So, I think that's what we should do for the time being, if you feel you're getting much worse, than I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can loot at your belly.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK, I will, yeah I will book then, book , I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book, and then, yeah.\nDoctor: Great! Cool! Do you have any more questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, , no, that's uh, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's uh, medical history, that would uh, I could be at some kind of risk.\nDoctor: Yes.\nDoctor: So, the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK, OK. Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. OK. Thank you very much doctor, for your time.

Is there any chance you could be pregnant?\nPatient: Uh, I really doubt it.\nDoctor: Fine. And so, you're not allergic to any medications. Fine from.\nDoctor: And what, what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seemed quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about?\nPatient: Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac. So, I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour, tumour or something? Because, I'm like this is, , really, the pain is so horrible that, or maybe a stroke. I don't know, it's, it's just like you know, you hear so many stories.\nPatient: That, you definitely start wonder, if i should go to A and E urgently, because , I might really have something serious.\nDoctor: OK. OK, fine. Um, now just, uh, another, uh, question, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that?\nPatient: No, no , no, no.\nDoctor: Uh, and when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your, your uh walk, are you walking a bit funny?\nPatient: Uh, not really.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird.\nDoctor: OK. So, just, just to clarify what, what you said . This morning, uh, you woke up and then later on in the, in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache?\nDoctor: Um, on the left side of the head?\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Left side of the head, is it behind the eye?\nPatient: Exactly.\nPatient: Sorry?\nDoctor: Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is?\nPatient: Uh, no, no it's, ugh, I don't know how to describe it. But it's, just like, , kind of.\nDoctor: Um, you've .\nDoctor: OK. That's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice.\nDoctor: Um, and, uh, you feeling dizzy as well, but your, you've got no neurological symptoms. You're walking fine.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Um, and, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that all? OK.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: So, it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Uh. Uh, no, it's the first time.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: But, to be honest, I'm very familiar with the disease, because my mother has it, so.\nPatient: Uh, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much, uh, early ages. So, that's why I'm not sure, if migraine makes sense. .\nDoctor: OK. So, um, usually with, with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives, so, sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older.\nDoctor: Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally.\nDoctor: So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head.\nDoctor: typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Now, um, uh, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well.\nDoctor: to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine.\nPatient: Ohh, that's great.\nDoctor: Um, I I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen?\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: OK. So, and, uh, you're, you're saying that if this is a migraine, and if I try that medication. This should go away, kind of, today?\nDoctor: So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people,\nDoctor: Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but .\nPatient: Ugh. OK. That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and , which you can get from the pharmacy.\nDoctor: Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication.\nDoctor: And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK. Sounds.\nDoctor: assessment to where we can see you today at some point.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it.\nPatient: OK, sounds good, yeah. Sounds, sounds a good plan.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, any, any questions for me?\nPatient: Uh, no, thank you very much. You were very helpful.\nDoctor: All right. OK. Um, any, any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know.\nPatient: OK, yeah. Thank you very much.\nDoctor: OK.

The pain is described as a 6 out of 10, with the patient mentioning a previous experience with kidney stones for reference. She has not taken any medication for this issue and does not have a history of headaches or other medical problems. There is a family history of migraines and hypothyroidism.

There was no neurological deficit noted in her motor strength, sensory function, or gait. However, she did appear to be in significant discomfort and was nauseous during the consultation. Visual acuity and extraocular movements could not be assessed due to the patient's self-reported visual disturbances.\n\n   Assessment (A): Based on the presentation, it is suspected that Maria may be experiencing her first migraine episode. The severity of her symptoms, the unilateral location of the headache, and the associated blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with a migraine. However, due to the patient's concern about a potential brain tumor or stroke, further investigation will be necessary.\n\n   Plan (P): The patient has been advised to try over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen, anti-sickness medication, and carbonated drinks for migraine relief.

It could be, cancer always comes up so.\nPatient: It'll be good if, none of those.\nDoctor: Great, so, so yeah. I can provide a bit of reassurance, um, and uh, we can talk about those a little bit, as well. And was there anything you were particularly expecting, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Um.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Uh. Uh, well, uh yeah, so reassurance. So like, hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious. But also, is there anything you can prescribe me to make it better? Or any advice?\nPatient: Or maybe even a sick note. So that, if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one.\nDoctor: Sure, sure, OK. All right, so, we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can , get a, um, those things, uh, and some reassurance, um, about your concerns.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So, um, you mentioned that you started with sore throat about a week ago, developed into bit of a dry cough. Um, , I'll just ask a few questions around those. So, um, do you have any shortness of breath?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of, . Yeah, I've been having shortness of breath, yeah.\nDoctor: You are short of breath. And, uh, do you have any wheeze? Or chest pain?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, a bit of both .\nDoctor: You're, you're feeling a bit wheezy, with some chest pain as well.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. And, how, ah, when did you start to develop the shortness of breath?\nPatient: . So, so the sore throat, so today's Friday, sore throat was about, last week, Friday or Thursday.\nPatient: Cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the, so the, shortness of breath was I think, shortly after the cough. So maybe a day or two later. So, three, four days ago.\nDoctor: Three or four days ago, you started develop . And is the cough worse at night-time?\nPatient: No, no, it's the same throughout the whole day.\nDoctor: Same throughout the day. Um, and, uh, when you say you're short of breath.\nDoctor: Just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So, are you able to, so , um, so, uh, like walk up a flight of stairs, for example? Um, or, or, are you short of breath at rest?\nPatient: Ohh yeah, it's, it's like, so when I'm doing walking. Um, and I do exercises now and then. So it, it hasn't been .\nPatient: Superbad like, hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual, and a little bit worrying.\nDoctor: And you're a bit concerned about that, OK.\nDoctor: So, I just need to ask a few, uh, things about your background as well. So, um, do you have any other medical conditions, or medical history?\nPatient: No, just, no, no , past medical history, no.\nDoctor: No . No history of asthma?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Um, and any, uh, uh, history of, uh, clots on your legs, or your lungs?\nDoctor: So these . Uh, no one in your family's had those? Clots on the legs, or the lungs?\nPatient: \nPatient: Well, my mother had lung cancer.\nDoctor: Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: You ever smoked? Or been exposed to asbestos? That you know of?\nPatient: Don't know with asbestos. Ever smoked, . I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, if that counts, but, not really.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and, uh, this, so just going back to the, your symptoms of shortness of breath, with the cough. It's a dry cough, no, you're not coughing up any flem?\nDoctor: Um, do, do you have, uh, and you don't, you say you don't have any chest pain, as such?\nDoctor: Um. Uh, are you taking any medications, currently, at the moment?\nPatient: Uh. No, no.\nDoctor: OK. Are you allergic to any medications?\nPatient: Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts.\nDoctor: Peanuts. OK. Um, and, uh.\nDoctor: You mentioned that your mother had, uh, lung cancer. Um, any other, family history of any significant illnesses, uh, run, running in your family?\nPatient: No, no, that's the only one. Just lung cancer, from my mother.\nDoctor: Just lung cancer. OK.\nDoctor: And you say you have a cold. So, do you have , sinus congestion? Or, um.\nPatient: No, it seems to be , entirely with just my throat. So like, my nose is like, .\nDoctor: So, , just your, just your throat. And, any recent travel? Or have you always lived in the UK?\nPatient: Uh, no, so I, I, I haven't always lived in the UK. Like, so I was born in the US, and moved over.\nPatient: Well, it was twelve years ago, but, in terms of recent travel. Just to Europe, nowhere too exotic.\nDoctor: OK, so no, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel any, anywhere. Um, OK.\nDoctor: And, are you coughing up anything other than, . Um, uh, so you, you're not coughing up blood, or anything like that? No, no.\nDoctor: Um, good. And, uh, are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty?\nPatient: Yeah, so, a little bit feverish, uh, um, at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then it, the fever's gone away.\nDoctor: OK. And in general, do you . Sorry? Yeah.\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah, I was just gonna say, also had a bit of a headache. But like, headaches that come and go rather, but like, right now it's fine.\nDoctor: Uh.\nDoctor: OK. And in general, would you say you're feeling, you're, you're beginning to, to feel better? Worse? Or, or sort of, um, staying the same?\nPatient: , so it's like, it's up and down. So, so let's see, so I, , it started last week, and I stayed home from work two days this week.\nPatient: I think it was maybe, Tuesday and then Thursday. So like, I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been, yeah, a kind of constant, but constant and being, variable, if that makes .\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And I just , need to ask any, other sort of risk factors. Um.\nDoctor: That you may have. So, , um, no sort of significant weight loss? Um, or unexplained weight loss? Any ?\nPatient: So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot so, and I, and I enjoy eating as well, but like, so that's been a bit concerning.\nDoctor: You've been losing your appetite recently?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: And you're a little bit concerned about that? But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight, that you think of?\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: No. Not that .\nDoctor: And any, um, sort of rashes or anything? Or, uh, , and you.\nPatient: No. Not .\nDoctor: Not that, not that you can think of. OK.\nDoctor: Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat, at least. To see if there's a, probably, there's.\nPatient: Ohh, we can try .\nDoctor: Ohh no, well, no, it's OK, I , might think about doing a. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck? That you can feel?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No that you, no, OK.\nDoctor: Um. And, so finally, you, you were talking about, uh, . I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down. Sore throat. Developed a dry cough.\nDoctor: Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of consultation now, . If you feel significantly worse .\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Um. Uh, if you get more short of breath, or sudden change in your breathlessness. Um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about. Then I would advise you to see, no , go and see a GP. Um, and actually see somebody physically.\nDoctor: Um, uh, but I think, for now I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up, as I expect it would. So, I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next, four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again.\nDoctor: Um, and, uh, I would expect it to, and so therefore, I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis\nDoctor: Um, your concerns about lung cancer, are. And, was that the other thing you're concerned about?\nPatient: Ohh yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nDoctor: Yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again.\nDoctor: Um, I've just got four seconds now. So, nice talking to you. And, have we gotta? We gotta, tidy up, yeah. OK, so, uh.\nPatient: All right.\nDoctor: Uh, and I'll provide you with a sick note, just to give you a few more days off work.\nDoctor: Um, and paracetemol. Lots of fluids. Um, and, uh, rest up. And, as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. OK?\nPatient: \nPatient: Have a good day.\nDoctor: .

Vincent is concerned that his symptoms may indicate serious conditions like tuberculosis, cancer, or blood clots.\n\n   Objective: On physical examination, there were no apparent abnormalities such as lumps or bumps around the neck.

And uh, are you in a sort of, uh, confidential place where you can speak freely?\nPatient: Yeah. No, no one else can hear me.\nDoctor: Great. And you're happy to continue with the consultation.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Marvelous. OK. So, um, how can i help today?\nPatient: Yeah, um. So basically it's, just been happening over the last few weeks or so.\nPatient: But I don't really feel like um, like, getting up in the morning's really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all, during the day, um.\nPatient: Often.\nPatient: Yeah just like, doing most things that I would normally find, easy , is become quite difficult.\nDoctor: OK. So, things have become quite difficult for you.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Is there anything else?\nPatient: Um, no it's quite hard to say like. Things like, I'm not, I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy.\nDoctor: OK. I'm sorry to hear that.\nDoctor: Um, so you had difficulty waking up. No energy, not eating.\nDoctor: And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? how many hours of sleep?\nPatient: Actually, well, now I kind of think about it maybe, maybe even longer, um. I guess uh, , might be related to, so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently.\nPatient: Um. It might of even coincided, coincided with uh, with that, job, a couple of months ago.\nDoctor: When did you start your new job? Two months ago, did you say?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. And, um, so this has been going on perhaps for um, sort of, six weeks or so?\nPatient: More like, , two months, I would say, yeah.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Alright. So, um,\nDoctor: Is there anything that you're particularly, sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation?\nPatient: Well, um, I, I know that it's not really normal for me, so, before this phase. So I'd have thing, you know I wouldn't have, uh, any problems sort of.\nPatient: , eating, what I want to eat, or you know, doing standard things in life, and, and, what I want, to do is just like, kind of return to that previous state.\nPatient: Uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is. Uh, what, what the best ways of doing that are, but, yeah. Do you have some advice or?\nDoctor: \nPatient: Whatever, that'd be really useful.\nDoctor: OK. Sure. OK. Um, well what would I like to do is just ask you a few more, sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and um, and things like that.\nDoctor: And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that alright?\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK, great. so you say you've been, um, feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that , do you tend to wake up early, and then stay in bed in the morning?\nPatient: Um, actually I'm, just uh, not, not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, really. I think that's probably closer.\nDoctor: , difficulty sleeping as well.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, and have you, and, how, how has your mood been over this period?\nDoctor: Have you been feeling your usual self?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Distracted, , I'd say. Uh, I, I kind of, um.\nPatient: Yeah, uh, finding it really hard to, quite, difficult to keep focusing, I would say.\nPatient: Um, not unhappy or, happy, but just uh, quite, just , not focused.\nDoctor: OK. So difficulty focusing, quite distracted.\nDoctor: And, would you say you've been in good spirits? Or is your mood low?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Actually uh, now you, you, you mention it like, my, mood is a bit lower recently.\nPatient: Um, and so I've noticed like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the, the past few months as well, so, yeah.\nDoctor: Right.\nDoctor: K. And uh, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well.\nDoctor: And, just on that note, just a few questions around that.\nDoctor: Are you able to, uh, it may be slightly personal questions, but if you're O. O. K. to answer this,\nDoctor: Do you tend to, to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed, ?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Um, I haven't noticed anything like that, specifically, no.\nDoctor: So, you've not, so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections, and usually you would. So, normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the morning with something. But you have not noticed those recently.\nPatient: Yes.\nPatient: I have not noticed those recently.\nDoctor: OK. So, and that's been a change, has it?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Important one I don't think, um, yeah. Not, I don't think it's important to change, no.\nDoctor: Sorry?\nDoctor: Uh, so you, you, you, you don't think there's been a change there. You\nPatient: No, there hasn't been a change there.\nDoctor: Ohh OK, sorry. Right, so\nDoctor: OK. So, um,\nDoctor: Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Uh, you have had uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been uh, slightly lower, with lower sex drive.\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, and in what way has your sex drive been lower? are you in a relationship at the moment?\nPatient: Yeah, I, I'm married, um, have been for, many years.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: And, uh, yeah just, um. Over the last few months, just uh, been disinterested.\nDoctor: Disinterested.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. Sorry, you froze there for a moment.\nDoctor: Um, . So less interested as well, OK.\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: And, just to ask you a few questions before we uh, wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history?\nDoctor: Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past, or any, uh, physical health problems?\nPatient: Um, so, in the past, um, I have a, a history of, hypothyroidism, um.\nDoctor: Hypo?\nPatient: Hypothyroidism.\nDoctor: Hyperthyroid.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: K, so that's high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that.\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Sorry, can you say that again please?\nDoctor: hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid.\nPatient: Hypo.\nDoctor: Hypo, OK. Hypothyroid. Thank you.\nPatient: Thank you. Um.\nPatient: Yeah, and uh, also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific, uh, medical diagnoses, along these lines.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Um, but the suspicion, that it may have uh, had an impact on me, but my father has commited suicide, um, about fifteen years ago.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK. And um,\nDoctor: Uh, do you take any medications?\nPatient: I had a, a, drug history of Thyroxine.\nDoctor: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: So, maybe, yes.\nDoctor: Do you, do you continue to take Thyrocsin now?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: You do. You're, so you're taking Thyrocsin at the moment?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications?\nPatient: No, I have no uh, medication allergies, no.\nDoctor: No.\nDoctor: No allergies. And you mentioned the , the suicide of your father fifteen years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, significant family history of medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No depression or anything like that running in your family, or uh,\nPatient: Uh, nothing, nothing, that sort.\nDoctor: OK. And your mother is, is well? Any brothers or sisters?\nPatient: Yeah she's fine, um, and no, I'm an only child. Um.\nDoctor: Um,\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: So, I just uh, uh, sorry it might seem like a slightly random question, but any uh, change in vision?\nDoctor: No\nPatient: No, no, nothing like that.\nDoctor: . OK. And, just to go back to your, you were saying you had low mood. Some people who , who do have low mood, uh, and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh, suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No.\nPatient: No, not , not really, no.\nDoctor: and are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities, that you have done in the past?\nPatient: Sometimes, I mean, I guess, um, most of the activites, but, when I've been doing sports as well, , I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe, um.\nPatient: So, I have some kind of like, shortness of breath um, when doing, sports, compared to maybe a couple of months ago.\nDoctor: OK. So you, you've become more short of breath over the last few months.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, and you've had a\nDoctor: OK. So uh, any other things around that? So, more fatigue, more shortness of breath, um, over the last few months?\nPatient: Mmm.\nDoctor: Um, with a low, lower mood, decreased sex drive. Um, is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?\nPatient: Um, no, nothing specific, no.\nDoctor: So, um,\nDoctor: We're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um,\nDoctor: I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well.\nDoctor: So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here.\nDoctor: Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more.\nPatient: , yes.\nPatient: That makes sense, yeah.\nDoctor: Is that alright?\nPatient: Yeah, that's very useful, thank you, um.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Yeah, it feels, better to have some kind of plan, uh.\nDoctor: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think , I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry, we've run out of time now.\nDoctor: Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests.\nDoctor: I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're , you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that.\nPatient: Mm-hmm, yes.\nDoctor: And, and you're, uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some your tiredness, and your other symptoms, when we see you.

It's just kinda scary, 'cause I haven't had, a time like this where I've been so, tight, uh, in a long time.\nDoctor: Yeah, absolutely, I can, I can imagine.\nDoctor: Um, well, it certainly sounds like uh, you've, you've had this cold, so you've got wheezy with a cough. Um, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at night-time?\nPatient: I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night but, basically, just pretty consistent, and it hasn't gone away.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you, you wouldn't say you've got chest pains? It's more of a tight chest, is it?\nPatient: No, not really pain, it's more like, tight.\nPatient: It just feels like sometimes, I can't get a full breath in, you know.\nDoctor: Yeah, sure. Um, OK. Well, I, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past?\nPatient: Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit, more like, back in high school. Um, but, I've been pretty good at taking my , my inhalers, so, not, not so much any more.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient? As in, you know, stayed in there overnight, for asthma?\nPatient: Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat.\nDoctor: Ohh, OK. So you, so, so you, uh, you , you went to hospital, and had a, a, . So you stayed in hospital for a few days did you, with an asthma exacerbation?\nPatient: Yeah I did, yeah.\nDoctor: OK, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil? And you haven't got any of those steroids, uh, those inhalers at the moment?\nPatient: Yeah, I'm doing pretty good, I'm doing pretty good, just on the Clenil, and the Salbutamol.\nDoctor: OK. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation?\nPatient: Uh, I think I was like seventeen.\nPatient: Sixteen maybe.\nDoctor: Sure. OK. Um.\nDoctor: Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have will you.\nPatient: No, no.\nDoctor: Um, are you able to, uh, like walk up, flights of stairs OK? Walk on the flat OK, without getting to short of breath? Or um, are you short of breath at rest?\nPatient: Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like, except for that feeling I was describing.\nPatient: It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like, I have a little bit, more short of breath than I would normally be.\nDoctor: Sure. Yeah. OK, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment?\nPatient: No, no, no I'm not.\nDoctor: OK, fine. So, what, what I think, um, and just to, just to go over, . Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh, a, prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this?\nPatient: Well I just wanna know that I'm OK, to just like keep. I just don't wanna have to get, um, that, that intubation again.\nDoctor: Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you have talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you, within the hour, I would hope.\nPatient: Uh, .\nDoctor: Um, and, uh, I think, what, the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a, dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning.\nDoctor: And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids. Which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects.\nDoctor: They're , most, you know , most of the time the steroids are, very well tolerated. And, uh, you . Have you had them in the past, do you know of?\nPatient: Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying?\nDoctor: . Have you had steroids in the past?\nPatient: Um, I can't remember, probably. I think so.\nDoctor: Probably, yeah I would too. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or too, slightly high.\nDoctor: Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, their. Uh, , they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot.\nDoctor: Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, , ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. , so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting wheezy.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours.\nDoctor: Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before?\nPatient: Yeah, yeah, I, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but.\nDoctor: Have you got one?\nPatient: I think I do, I have one somewhere.\nDoctor: OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or , five or ten breaths.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Uh, yeah. So.\nDoctor: Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage?\nPatient: , I think you got me covered.\nDoctor: OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right?\nPatient: OK, .\nPatient: All righty. Well, thank you very much.\nDoctor: OK. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed.\nDoctor: Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK?\nPatient: All right, sounds good.\nDoctor: OK. Thank you.\nPatient: OK, thank you.

Uh, you said you're eating OK?\nPatient: Yeah, yeah, fine.\nDoctor: I mean it, from the sounds of it, it does, sound quite like a migraine, but obviously if you had no history of that, in the past.\nDoctor: Um, and is anything changed recently, or any, anything you've done recently might've, triggered it?\nPatient: Uh, not that I can think of, um, may have been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing, but .\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Yeah. Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated.\nDoctor: Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache. Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you.\nDoctor: Straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches.\nDoctor: Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help the, that longer-term.\nPatient: OK, brilliant, thank you.\nDoctor: Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while.\nDoctor: Uh, and, thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature's OK.\nPatient: OK, sure.\nPatient: Yep.\nDoctor: If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting worse, or you develop any rashes or anything like that. Then we'd need to speak to you straight away.\nPatient: Yep, OK, that's brilliant. OK, so I'll take some Ibuprofen and I'll um, hopefully, be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah.\nDoctor: OK, so, have you got any other questions?\nPatient: Uh, no, that was it today.\nDoctor: OK. OK then, we'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again.\nPatient: OK, brilliant. Thanks so much.\nDoctor: , very much.

Um, I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it's started to really worry me, and just add up, and build up on that anxiety. And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP.\nDoctor: OK. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about, when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time?\nPatient: Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um.\nPatient: Which I , I would say it's quite , I mean every job is stressful, and when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely.\nDoctor: What's your job?\nPatient: Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and I don't.\nPatient: But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there. I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not.\nPatient: And it's really impacting on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that.\nDoctor: OK. So, um, just day-to-day, tell me, from the start of your day, how it affects you. You said that you, you dread going to work.\nDoctor: How, how does it affect you, in terms of like your sleep at night, and things like that?\nPatient: Right.\nPatient: Yeah, this is really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed.\nPatient: But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So I.\nDoctor: OK. So what time, what time do you go to bed at night-time?\nPatient: About ten, eleven, probably.\nDoctor: And what time do you get to sleep?\nPatient: Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night\nDoctor: OK. And, when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning, or does something else wake you up, before then?\nPatient: Mmm.\nPatient: So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning.\nDoctor: OK. And, so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night?\nPatient: , I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now.\nDoctor: OK. And, what about your eating patterns, any change in how you're eating, or whether you, your appetite's changed?\nPatient: Probably, not, significant changes maybe. No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently. Ohh that, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down.\nDoctor: OK. You're eating regularly otherwise?\nPatient: Yeah, .\nDoctor: OK. And, you told me about the palpitations, just tell me a bit more about that.\nPatient: Yeah, So um, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired.\nPatient: Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating. It's just really, really stressful. I don't know if it's, stress or if, , or I did think it was like, a heart problem really actually.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Does it feel like a regular fast beat, or an irregular, beat?\nPatient: Irregular, I think.\nDoctor: And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it?\nPatient: Ohh it can be anything, I think couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes.\nDoctor: OK. Is that something that you've had before this, or is that a new thing?\nPatient: Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past. Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this.\nDoctor: OK. Any chest pain with that?\nPatient: No, um, well yeah it's painful to , when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And, in the daytime, how, how, you said you, you're not getting much sleep so, how's your energy level in the daytime?\nPatient: It's just, really, really low, I mean I, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all.\nPatient: It's kind of day-to-day, and anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable. And I'm like, yeah, on edge the whole time.\nDoctor: OK. So what do you do in the evenings?\nPatient: Well right now I'm, I'm working so late, and everything is really, really stressful. So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax. It, it seems quite difficult to do that.\nDoctor: OK, and , are you avoiding contact with friends, or do you still see them?\nPatient: I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm.\nPatient: Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done.\nDoctor: OK. What about, hobbies, or exercise, or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work?\nPatient: Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and.\nPatient: And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much.\nDoctor: And have you, has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work?\nPatient: No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, just not go.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And, what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever, been, um, so overwhelmed that you couldn't, get in to the office, you couldn't, go into a situation?\nDoctor: Have you ever had a panic attack?\nPatient: , um.\nPatient: No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work.\nPatient: But I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call, I'm just worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I have, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of months.\nDoctor: OK. And apart from work, are there any other situations which evoke quite extreme anxiety, like being, in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that?\nPatient: Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless.\nPatient: Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well.\nDoctor: OK. Before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this?\nPatient: Not really I, I'm, no, I would say. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before.\nDoctor: OK. And what about your mood day-to-day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by like that. Do you ever get really down about this?\nPatient: Yeah.\nPatient: Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being and not just my day at all 'cause.\nPatient: I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy.\nDoctor: When do you think you last felt yourself?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a on that at all.\nDoctor: . And has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job, or with your life, or with your normal, uh, things as they we're going on?\nPatient: I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't.\nPatient: You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff. So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this.\nDoctor: Yeah. OK. And where do you, who do you live with at home?\nPatient: Sorry?\nDoctor: Who do you live with at home?\nPatient: Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents.\nDoctor: Um, and, how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think?\nPatient: Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um.\nPatient: Uh, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much.\nDoctor: OK. So, how much would you, would you guess?\nPatient: Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like.\nPatient: I probably go over my limit just on those days, anyway, and then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week .\nDoctor: OK. Do you smoke or take any other drugs, or anything?\nPatient: Um, I try not to smoke, but I do, occasionally, but I don't take drugs.\nDoctor: OK. And have you done , anything yourself to help? Have you , have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors? Done any, online, looked online at all? Any ways to ?\nPatient: I, well I talk to my mum, because she also suffers from, well she's , suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from, actual depression because it just seems to be, manifesting as, as total , as just stress the whole time.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: But um, I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, um, but I haven't sought any other.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And would you be happy to, have, some one-to-one therapy?\nPatient: \nPatient: Yeah I think, yeah I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah.\nDoctor: OK. I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to. So you can self-refer via the NHS, for what we call like, talking therapy which is a type of inter-behavioural, where they can really look at your situation. How you're reacting to, the, , why, what's provoking anxiety, and what you can do, to try and overcome that.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, so I can send you the link for that.\nDoctor: Um, in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful. Um, can put the details, on there and you can, get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well.\nPatient: Uh-huh.\nDoctor: Um, and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all, or your anxiety is getting worse, to the point where you can't cope with work, or you can't, just do your normal things day-to-day. Then, it's important for us to, for you to give us a call, back and just discuss that, further.\nPatient: OK. .\nDoctor: I mean some people, with anxiety they, do need to take medication to control that but that's, not something that we'd suggest in the first instance.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And I'll put some more information on your notes about, helping with your, sleep patterns and things like that.\nPatient: That's great, I look forward to reading it.\nDoctor: Um, in terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be a, , associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that, there's not something triggering that off. And then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the tests, so we can just go through the results with you.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK, OK. Yeah, .\nDoctor: So if you call the support line you can arrange the, to have the blood test done.\nPatient: OK, I'll call them up.\nDoctor: OK?\nPatient: Thank you so much.\nDoctor: All right.

She has been experiencing these symptoms for approximately two months, which coincides with the start of her new job in fashion retail head office. The patient reports feeling nervous every morning about leaving the house, dread going to work, and hating speaking to her boss. This has significantly impacted her sleep, appetite, and mood. She described palpitations, particularly upon waking in the mornings, which she fears may be a heart problem. She avoids contact with friends due to feeling down and lacking enjoyment.\n\n   Objective: Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 95 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. No signs of distress were observed. The patient appears distressed and anxious during the consultation.\n\n   Assessment: The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with anxiety disorder, possibly triggered by work-related stress. The palpitations are likely secondary to her anxiety. Sleep disturbance is also a common symptom of anxiety.\n\n   Plan: The patient will self-refer for talking therapy (interpersonal behavioral therapy) via the NHS. In the meantime, she was advised to access online resources for managing anxiety and sleep disorders. If symptoms worsen or become unmanageable, she is encouraged to contact the practice.

The patient will have a follow-up appointment with the GP one week after the blood test results are available."}

Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off.\nDoctor: I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.\nDoctor: Um, so.\nPatient: So, how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water? I'm throwing up everything.\nDoctor: Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.\nDoctor: 'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Ohh, OK. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done?\nDoctor: Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So you can call us back in the meantime.\nPatient: OK. So, what I'll do is, yeah. If you could, please book me the appointment and, um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, for the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to the A and E, and, um .\nDoctor: Yeah. If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly, to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it.\nDoctor: Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: OK.

So, just tell me about the last, did you say five days?\nPatient: Yeah, five days or so ago.\nDoctor: OK. How about your cough at the moment?\nPatient: Uh, it's quite bad. It's kind of quite dry, um.\nPatient: I'm coughing maybe every twenty, thirty minutes or so.\nDoctor: OK, you bringing up any phlegm at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: No. Any chest pain?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: Chest what, sorry?\nDoctor: Any pain in your chest?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath or any pain when you take a deep breath?\nPatient: No, that's all fine.\nDoctor: Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that?\nPatient: Nope.\nDoctor: And what about your nose symptoms?\nDoctor: Are you front of your sinuses or anything?\nPatient: Uh, just .\nPatient: Uh, nothing up in here but just constant streaming, like, using a million tissues.\nDoctor: OK.

Sore throat?\nPatient: Uh, I I've been feeling really hot, um, I don't know if it's fever as such, but, like, to touch I'm quite hot but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly, needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing.\nDoctor: Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer?\nPatient: Uhh, no, I haven't.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and are you eating and drinking normally?\nPatient: Uhh, yes. Um, kind of around when it started, I had some diarrhoea, but I don't know if that was associated. But since then it's all been pretty fine.\nDoctor: OK. So, you're drinking well, holding down fluids OK?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: And passing water OK?\nPatient: Yeah, that's fine.\nDoctor: No vomiting, diarrhoea now?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK, that's fine. Um, any rashes that you've noticed?\nPatient: Rashes? Uhh, no, nothing like that.\nDoctor: Yeah.\nDoctor: Any headaches or change in your vision?\nPatient: No, um, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it.\nDoctor: OK. And normally, do you have any chest problems?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath?\nPatient: Uh, I mean, like, if I do intense exercise, then yes. But not .\nDoctor: . And, do you regularly have any infections in your chest, or anything that needs treatment, normally?\nPatient: No, uh, I've got hypertension, um, so I'm on some drugs for that, um, but that's it, really.\nDoctor: OK. Um, any other medical problems?\nPatient: Uh, just the hypertension and the diabetes.\nDoctor: OK, and what type of drugs are you on?\nPatient: Uh, I think something called metformin, and lisinopril I think is the other one.\nDoctor: OK, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked?\nPatient: Uh, ooh, uh, a while ago. Um, .\nDoctor: Do you know if it, do you know if it's been stable?\nPatient: Uh, I can't remember.\nDoctor: OK. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently?\nPatient: Um, yeah. Like.\nPatient: Yeah, it was normal. It was around three weeks ago.\nDoctor: OK, and do you know what dose of the lisinopril you're taking?\nPatient: Uh, two hundred.\nDoctor: OK. Have you been able to pass water normally?

I'm an office manager.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've bought in the chemist?\nPatient: Um, uh, a quite a few lemon sips. Um, they seems to be helping.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Do you, what, what do you mean by quite a few? How many in, in a day do you normally take?\nPatient: Uh, maybe two or three. Maybe, like, at the start of the day and at the end of the day.\nDoctor: OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that?\nPatient: Yeah. It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep.\nDoctor: OK. Um, do you have any allergies to anything?\nPatient: Uh, I sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever. But, um, but it's not bad\nDoctor: Any . Any allergies to any medications at all?\nPatient: Not that I'm aware of, no.\nDoctor: OK. So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest. Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.\nPatient: OK. I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something?\nDoctor: Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves. But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.\nDoctor: Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature.\nDoctor: Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose,\nDoctor: um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK. So, then we would at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps?\nDoctor: Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, have you got any other questions?\nPatient: Um, no, that's all fine.\nDoctor: It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip. I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down.\nPatient: OK. Cool.\nDoctor: OK? Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for?\nPatient: Yep.\nPatient: I'm not at home.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: OK, great.

Um, because this, yeah, this was weird, this sort of came up, and then, uh.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Disappeared after a couple of weeks, where's the light, that, you see that?\nDoctor: OK, right, yeah, whereabouts was it?\nPatient: Uh, I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually.\nDoctor: When did you first notice it?\nPatient: Um, probably, uh, around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb. And then it, like, it didn't actually cause too much itching, or anything, at the time. And, I, it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess.\nDoctor: Did you have any fevers at that time?\nPatient: Um, I, to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat I had, um, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I, I sort of put it down to that.\nDoctor: Do you know where you got that, when it started? Had you been walking, did you get any bites that you noticed?\nPatient: Uh, I like, I do quite a lot of walking, and we did, um, quite a lot while we were out in the, on holiday as well, but definitely, um.\nPatient: Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't recall any bugs, I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and, and boots but /\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Whereabouts were you in the States?\nPatient: Um, just sort of, um, he examined me, so.\nDoctor: OK, and any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness?\nPatient: Um, no.\nPatient: But it's the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy.\nPatient: \nDoctor: And have you been able to go to work as usual?\nPatient: Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been. But, yeah, been, been.\nDoctor: And what's your job?\nPatient: Um, I work for a health technology company actually.\nDoctor: OK, and has your concentration been affected, or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work?\nPatient: Yeah, definitely sort of tired and, um, yeah, less energy, sort of probably than I, I would normally be.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Have you been able to exercise OK?\nPatient: Um.\nPatient: Not as much. I, I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I I'm not exercising as I would normally.\nDoctor: OK, fine, and, um, how's your mental health, your stress levels, all that?\nPatient: Hey.\nPatient: Pretty good at the moment, actually. Like, it previously that has been an issue, but, um.\nPatient: Other than, sort of, physically feeling a bit.\nPatient: Uh, crappy, I've.\nPatient: Yeah, in a pretty good place.\nDoctor: OK. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin, or swelling of your joints, or pain in your joints?\nPatient: Uh, yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah. Not ,\nDoctor: Any swelling that you've noticed?\nPatient: No, .\nDoctor: Your hands, wrists, ankles, toes.\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: OK, um, and any other significant medical problems in the past?\nPatient: Uh, I mean.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Pardon?\nPatient: Asthma and hay fever if they can help.\nDoctor: OK. Any flare-ups of your asthma recently?\nPatient: Uh, no, pretty well , I think.\nDoctor: Do you take your regular inhalers or other medication?\nPatient: Uh, yeah. I've got one of those, um, preventative, I think. Yeah , but I've not used one.\nDoctor: You haven't been using it, you said?\nPatient: I, I have it. I've been using the everyday for the morning and night but not the, uh, .\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: And any, erm, do you take any other medications?\nPatient: Um, I take, um, one of the antihistamines it might be can I get that from, just from the pharmacy.\nDoctor: Yeah, that's fine. Um, and do you smoke?\nPatient: uh, .\nDoctor: Drink any alcohol?\nDoctor: No.\nPatient: Sorry, occasionally, that was.\nDoctor: OK, and who do you live with at home?\nPatient: Uh, just my wife.\nDoctor: Um.\nDoctor: Sorry, um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels.\nDoctor: Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that?\nPatient: \nPatient: Uh, yeah, I but, uh, what, what's the infection?\nDoctor: Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite.\nDoctor: So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done.\nPatient: OK, so, do the test first and then, and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or, yeah.\nDoctor: Um, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with.\nPatient: All right. Excellent.\nDoctor: OK?\nPatient: That, that's really helpful, thank you very much.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Oops, sorry, you broke up a bit there.\nDoctor: Any other questions?\nPatient: Ohh, no, not , no.\nDoctor: OK, that's great.

{"id": 55, "prompt": "Below is a conversation between a doctor and a patient.\n\nTranscript:\nDoctor: Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon.\nDoctor: Can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please?\nPatient: Um, it's .\nPatient: \nDoctor: . Um, I can't hear you at the moment actually. Could you turn it up, the, volume up?\nPatient: Uh, can you hear me better now?\nDoctor: . Yeah, that's better. Thank you.\nPatient: Um, OK. Sorry about that.\nDoctor: Are you in a private place you can have a consultation?\nPatient: Uh, yes.\nDoctor: What can I do for you today?\nPatient: Um, I've been having this, blinding headache for a few days. Um, and it's like, really bothering me and , I find it very hard to focus or, like I can't even go to work.\nDoctor: OK, and any headaches in the past before this?\nPatient: Not really just they're, on and off. Um, I recently had a, a one for like two days, um, but it just went away with Ibuprofen, so nothing like, more, longer than two days before.\nDoctor: So, how did this start?\nPatient: Um, it just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache, and that was three days ago, and I just keep having it.\nPatient: Doesn't really go away with Ibuprofen either, I try that, but it just. It gets a little bit better but like, doesn't go away.\nDoctor: OK, and whereabouts in your head is the pain?\nPatient: Um, it's kind of all over but, I feel like over my right eye, it's um bit, stronger.\nDoctor: OK. Any problems with your vision? Or, any problems tolerating the light?\nPatient: Um, lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like, um, I don't really, like strong lights.\nPatient: Um, and um, yeah, vision I think, I get this, shooting light sometimes.\nPatient: Um, not sure how to explain it. Just a bit of um, weird kind of vision.\nDoctor: OK, and um, any, any nausea or vomiting?\nPatient: Uh, no, feeling a bit sick, but no vomiting.\nDoctor: Any tingling? Or numbness? Or weakness anywhere?\nPatient: Um, no.\nDoctor: Any change in your smell or taste?\nPatient: No, none at all.\nDoctor: Um, and, in the past, when you've had headaches, what have they been like?\nPatient: Um, I was sick but I had no more headache, it's just um, a bit of a pressure, in between my eyes, um.\nPatient: But nothing major.\nDoctor: OK, and, with, with this, has it been there all the time? Or is it coming and going?\nPatient: Kinda all the time. Um, so when I take Ibuprofen it gets a bit better, so it's a bit, like less um, it, it bothered me less, but then I still have it, it's still there.\nDoctor: Um, and what would you say, the severity is? If, if ten is the worst pain you've ever had, and zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like?\nPatient: I guess it's mostly, eight, and then it kinda comes down to maybe a five.\nDoctor: OK, and what about at night-time, are you able to fall asleep?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I'm, sleeping well.\nDoctor: Is it waking you up in the night-time?\nPatient: No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning.\nDoctor: OK. Any worse when you change position, or bend over, or cough, or anything like that?\nPatient: Mmm.\nPatient: Sometimes when I stand up, quickly I get a bit of a, stabbing pain. Um, or if I throw my head like, it I kind of feel like something is moving inside.\nDoctor: OK. And have you had any, uh, eye checks recently?\nPatient: Um, yeah, actually had one recently and, nothing changed my vision.\nDoctor: OK. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears, or pain over the sinuses? Any cough or flem?\nPatient: No, no.\nPatient: \nDoctor: No. Any, any nose bleeds, or coughing up any blood or anything?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And just recently, have you been well, or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight? Or, tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that?\nPatient: Um, no change of weight, maybe um, lack of energy but it might be because, I'm just having these headaches. so I'm find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities , you know when you have this constant headache.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: Have you been at work recently?\nPatient: Um, I work from home but, couldn't really manage to, do it all the time. So sometimes I just took a day off.\nDoctor: So, you've been, you've had a headache for three days. , how many days have you missed off work?\nPatient: Um, so I worked from home all these three days and, um. First day I worked from home and then, um, the second I just took the whole day off. And, today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but, I, I just stopped in the morning 'cause, I couldn't focus.\nDoctor: OK. And, any other, medical problems in the past?\nPatient: Um, I think I only had a, a pain, um, when I was younger but, no causes found and that went away, but that's, the only thing I know of.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. Have you been abroad recently at all?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Do you take any medications?\nPatient: Um, just the pill.\nDoctor: Which one?\nPatient: Um, .\nDoctor: And when did you start that?\nPatient: Um, about a year ago.\nDoctor: Any side effects with that?\nPatient: Uh, no I don't think so.\nDoctor: Have you noticed any, any um, increased frequency of headaches since you started that?\nPatient: Um, no, , these headaches just very recently, but nothing um, but nothing really changes.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: OK. And when you'd , when you've had, when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms? Flashing lights? Nausea, vomiting with them?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: No, no.\nPatient: No nothing, none of those.\nDoctor: Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill?\nPatient: Um, yeah, I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill, and they say it was normal.\nDoctor: And when was that?\nPatient: Uh, a year ago.\nDoctor: OK. Um, and any allergies to anything?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: And who do you live with at home?\nPatient: Sorry?\nDoctor: Who do you live with at home?\nPatient: Uh, just by myself.\nDoctor: OK. And do you smoke?\nPatient: Uh, no.\nDoctor: Do you drink any alcohol regularly?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: How much in a normal week do you think?\nPatient: Um, probably like, three , once a week.\nDoctor: . OK. And do you take any other drugs at all?\nPatient: Um, no apart from the Ibuprofen that I take, sometimes when, the headache gets really bad, nothing else.\nDoctor: OK.\nDoctor: Um. So, uh, I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache. And you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well?\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: But you haven't had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature?\nPatient: Uh, no I didn't, I don't really feel, feverish or anything.\nDoctor: OK. Um, I mean it, it, it could possibly be a migraine type headache.\nDoctor: But, the fact it's still ongoing for three days, we probably should, book you into an appointment to get an examination.\nPatient: \nDoctor: Um, obviously , if it settles, in the meantime then, we can cancel that. But we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Um, in terms of medication, I can prescribe you something, similar to Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger which you can take instead of Ibuprofen. And you can also take Paracetamol at the same time.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So if you're happy to book a, , appointment with us, with the support line, for us to do a full examination.\nDoctor: And start, the medication which I prescribe to you, take it with food.\nDoctor: If, if you're, you said that when you go to bed your headache's, OK, and not waking you up in the night-time.\nPatient: Yeah it's not, um but, you mentioned migraine and that um, reminded that, my mum, suffers from, like she has migraines, um.\nDoctor: OK. Any other family history of medical problems?\nPatient: Um, no I think that's it, but I know that my mum like, she has quite bad migraines, she's like, has the vomiting and everything, .\nDoctor: OK that's fine. Um, I mean if, if in the meantime before your appointment your, headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing. Then , um, if it's that bad, then you should go to A and E and have an examination.\nDoctor: Um, , you can call us for further advice on that.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Mm-hmm, OK.\nDoctor: And when, when you have a, an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well.\nDoctor: Just to, make sure your pill's still appropriate for you, because sometimes if we, if we do think it's a migraine, then you would have to change your pill. If you've had these flashing lights, and things like that.\nPatient: \nPatient: OK, .\nPatient: Is there anything in the pill that can cause it? Or is it?\nDoctor: Well , some , so that pill if you were having , regular migraines with um, flashing lights, or , other symptoms. It wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly, we'd have to change it to something else.\nPatient: All right.\nDoctor: But you can carry on with that for the moment.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: Have you got any other questions?\nPatient: Um, so will you like, um, send me a referral to a specialist, or do I have to to confirm?\nDoctor: Uh.\nDoctor: Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then.\nPatient: OK.

I mean I play a lot of sports. Um, and I had a , like I play some ice hockey, and I had this injury a few months ago.\nPatient: You know I just like, fell on the ice and, and, you know had a, huge bruise but, I think that's about it.\nDoctor: OK, So, um, at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing, normally.\nPatient: So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon, um, that's gonna happen in, June. And so, I'm trying to run like.\nPatient: I mean right now, I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so, I started about uh, maybe a month ago.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles, and I've just done like a couple of seven, mile runs.\nPatient: And then uh, uh, and then you know I go to the gym like few times a week and, kinda do my, usual routine.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has, have been, the runs, the longer runs.\nDoctor: And, have you had, any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you?\nPatient: Um, well, I, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what, what that means.\nDoctor: So, it means if you're, if you're there and uh, you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you.\nPatient: Not, not bad, I mean it just kinda starts hurting, you know. Um.\nDoctor: And does it hurt, uh, how far into the run does it generally hurt?\nPatient: You know I would say probably starts off like after, uh, maybe, twenty minutes or so. Which is, probably I don't know like somewhere around mile, three maybe, two and a half or three miles.\nDoctor: OK. Ooh you're fast. Um.\nPatient: switching my kilometres and miles, I'm not sure, all right.\nDoctor: Um. And, um, do you have to stop running, or can you run through the pain?\nPatient: Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped, because it was um, I, I feel like it's getting worse.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: Um, and, when I start doing my abs, that's, you know when I do my abs. It's kind of requiring me to move my you know, um, to kind of go from the flex position on my knees, and straighten my legs, then I feel all this clicking.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And, I think that's also freaked me out, and uh, I just figured you know, something's wrong here.\nDoctor: Right. And, you said before, it's both knees.\nPatient: So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts.\nDoctor: \nDoctor: And, any problems with your left one?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK, and, can you just describe in the knee, or show me whereabouts the pain, is happening mainly?\nPatient: So, ah, you know I, I feel it, it's kind of weird, I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of uh, um, moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit.\nDoctor: OK. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee?\nPatient: So, yes, well it's, I have, probably some fluid. I googled it, and you know it says that sometimes fluid accumulates uh, I.\nDoctor: OK. , does it look swollen to you?\nPatient: Sorry?\nDoctor: Does the knee look swollen?\nPatient: Um, well it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it, and it went away.\nDoctor: \nPatient: Um, but, right now, right now it's not swollen, and right now it doesn't hurt, you know.\nPatient: Um, but, it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it, there's no clicking but, I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it'll start hurting.\nDoctor: OK, and, if you're sitting, still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any problems just walking normally?\nPatient: No, none, I don't.\nDoctor: And intervals of range of movement. Are you able to fully straighten the leg?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: And what about fully flex it?\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: OK. Are you taking any medication for the knee?\nPatient: Well, um, since you're asking. Um, yes I , I take Ibuprofen, um, and I'll just kinda, use it sometime like uh, um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of, is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that.\nPatient: But you know it's nothing like major maybe, like, four hundred milligrams max, something like that.\nPatient: I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint.\nPatient: Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it.\nDoctor: OK, and any other joint problems, that you're getting? Any back pains? Small swelling of your, hands, feet, elbows, wrists? Any pain?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation.\nDoctor: OK.\nPatient: And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run.\nPatient: There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so.\nDoctor: On your right side.\nPatient: Yes.\nDoctor: Any change in colour, or temperature of your lower legs?\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: Any swelling which stays if you push in, and then you release it, that it stays there?\nPatient: Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, .\nDoctor: Yeah, any, or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that?\nPatient: No, no, nothing like that, no.\nDoctor: Um, and, with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered senstation, tingling numbness, anything like that?\nPatient: No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while.\nDoctor: OK.And any pain in the joints of your foot or , on the underside in the arch? Any problems walking round on hard floors?\nPatient: No.\nPatient: No.\nDoctor: OK, have you had, any other medical problems before?\nPatient: Uh, well, I had uh.\nPatient: You know what just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery.\nPatient: And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER.\nPatient: And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine.\nPatient: Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good.\nPatient: \nDoctor: OK, and, do you take any other medications, apart from the ones you told me about?\nPatient: Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D.\nPatient: Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually , uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is.\nPatient: Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs.\nPatient: You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax.\nPatient: Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work.\nDoctor: OK. And, any problems with your stomach, or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux?\nPatient: No, no, no problems.\nDoctor: . And, what I would suggest is, definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So, as much as you can, 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries.\nDoctor: Brings the healing blood into the area, and it gives it the best chance of, getting better. So, as much as you can, use the ice.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme, but.\nDoctor: Um, I would, try and ease up on the running, if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're, having to stop running, then it's not a good idea, to do that.\nDoctor: Um. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger, anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen.\nPatient: Hmm.\nDoctor: But make sure that with food. Ultimately we probably need to, examine the knee.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Um, so, the best thing I would, suggest, getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long, assessment, and examination of the knee.\nDoctor: And then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any, um, imagery to , have a look inside the knee, and see if there's any problem with the, cartilage.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break.\nPatient: So do you think it's that, or?\nDoctor: Um, it's, it's not really possible to, diagnose that over the , over the video. So we definitely would need to, see you. And, the, a physio is the best point of call, because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment.\nPatient: Right.\nDoctor: But certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you in our clinic as well.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: OK.\nPatient: Can you, so are you going to send referral for that?\nDoctor: Yep, we can, we can do a referral before that. If in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee, or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it.\nPatient: OK. Great.\nDoctor: Then, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back in that, case. .\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nPatient: That sounds good. Thank you yeah. , sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try.\nDoctor: OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK? Thank you, bye.\nPatient: OK. Sweet.
