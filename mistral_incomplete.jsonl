And usually I can talk to her whilst I run, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really sure of that when I'm walking. Um, but definitely um, if I'm walking briskly now.

So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading? Where you blow into, you know\nDoctor: Do you do that? No?\nPatient: Um, just every now and then. I haven't done overlap since I've has symptoms.\nDoctor: OK.

You can use it maximum about every two to four, four hours, but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: But uh, the brown your Clenil. The brown inhaler.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: You can up the dose. If you're using just three puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day.\nDoctor: Yeah. And while, this is to do while you're waiting to see us.\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\nDoctor: Now, I've mentioned, you know, you're doing you know, increase the, uh, Clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: And your breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A and E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment.\nDoctor: OK. So, when you'd opt to sneeze you, what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest, yeah.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: Make you do the peak flow reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics and some steroids.\nPatient: Yeah.\nDoctor: But anyway, while you're at home, we're going to by increasing your Clenil, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway.\nPatient: OK.\nDoctor: So, yeah. So, any questions you wanted to ask me?\nPatient: No, that's thanks.\nDoctor: Yeah. So, book an call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that meet her face to face.\nDoctor: In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day, and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly.
