 Subjective: The patient reports a three-day history of diarrhea and abdominal pain with occasional vomiting. The patient also mentions frequent need to use the restroom and increased frequency of going to the bathroom. He admits to forgetting water intake but thinks he may not be drinking enough. There is no reported presence of blood in stool or vomit.

   Objective: The patient's abdomen was soft on palpation with tenderness localized to the central area under the belly button. The patient appears to be able to walk and talk without difficulty, but mentions a slight increase in anxiety due to a recent change in his asthma inhaler brand. No chest pain or shortness of breath reported.

   Assessment: Possible gastroenteritis (stomach infection) possibly caused by consuming contaminated food or water. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The patient should drink plenty of fluids and rest at home.

   Plan: The patient will be advised to drink lots of water and fluids and monitor for any fever. He will stay at home until symptoms improve. If symptoms worsen, the patient is encouraged to see a general practitioner in person. Antibiotics are unlikely to help in this situation and may make the condition worse. The patient's concerns about his family history of bowel cancer will be addressed by scheduling an appointment with his GP for further evaluation if symptoms do not improve. The patient was reassured and thanked for his time.
