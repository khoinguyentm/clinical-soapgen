 SOAP Note:

Subjective: The patient, Susan (DOB: 02/04/1974), reported a six-day history of lower abdominal pain (7/10 on the pain scale) and dysuria with hematuria. She also described an unpleasant smell associated with urination. The patient has been experiencing intermittent tummy pain in the middle, and there are no other reported symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or back pain, or vaginal discharge.

Objective: The patient's vital signs were not documented during this consultation. Her abdomen was tender upon palpation with no rebound tenderness or guarding. No other pertinent physical findings were noted.

Assessment: The patient presents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) based on her symptoms and lack of a prior history. The UTI may have been contributing to her dysuria, hematuria, and unpleasant odor during urination. The tummy pain could be related to the UTI or may be an unrelated issue.

Plan: The patient will start a three-day course of antibiotics for the UTI. She should pick up the prescription from Knightsbridge Practice as soon as possible and begin taking the medication immediately. The patient was advised to drink plenty of water (2.5-3 liters per day) and consume cranberry juice, which may help alleviate symptoms. Additionally, she can purchase sachets from the chemist to change the acidity of her urine. If symptoms worsen, recur, or if the patient develops lower back pain, fever, or problems passing urine, it is important that they contact the healthcare provider again. The patient was not advised to call after finishing the course of antibiotics unless symptoms persist or recur.
