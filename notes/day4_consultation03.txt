 Subjective: The patient, Sarah Smith, reports experiencing shortness of breath for an hour while watching TV. She also mentions having a cough that started yesterday. Sarah had a C-section four weeks ago and is currently with her baby. She feels stressed due to her heart beating faster than normal.

   Objective: Shortness of breath, cough, increased heart rate, C-section scar tenderness, allergic to Ibuprofen, no known other medical issues. The patient's heart rate was measured at 30 beats per minute during the call.

   Assessment: Sarah Smith is experiencing shortness of breath, likely due to a possible pulmonary embolism related to her recent C-section. She also has a cough and an increased heart rate. Her C-section scar is tender.

   Plan: Sarah should go to the hospital immediately for further examination. She should avoid taking Codeine at this time. If a blood clot is confirmed, she will be given medication to reduce it. The patient lives alone, so she may need assistance in getting to the hospital with her baby.
