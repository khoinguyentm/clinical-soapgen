 Subjective: The patient, Laura Parkinson, is a 45-year-old female who presents with a complaint of soreness and cracked skin on her hands for the past few months. She reports that the condition has worsened to the point of causing pain and affecting her ability to perform her job as a housekeeper. The skin is itchy, dry, and cracked, particularly on the palms.

   Objective: On physical examination, the patient's hands were visibly dry and cracked, with some signs of itching. There was no evidence of bleeding or infection. The patient also reported general dryness in other parts of her body but did not consider it severe.

   Assessment: The patient likely has contact dermatitis, possibly due to exposure to cleaning chemicals at her job as a housekeeper and infrequent glove use.

   Plan:
   1. Avoid triggers: The patient was advised to wear gloves when cleaning at all times.
   2. Topical treatment: Steroid creams were recommended to reduce inflammation, along with stronger emollients to help moisturize the skin.
   3. Follow-up: The patient was instructed to return if symptoms persist or worsen in about a week to two weeks. If necessary, other treatments may be considered.
   4. Medication: A prescription for the recommended creams and emollients was arranged for the patient's pharmacy.

   Education: The patient was informed that her condition should improve within ten days to fourteen days with treatment, but to return sooner if symptoms worsen or spread.
