There was no fever noted, and her respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. She was dehydrated due to the lack of fluid intake associated with her symptoms.

   Assessment: The patient likely has a viral upper respiratory infection based on her symptoms of cough, runny nose, muscle pain, and fatigue. Her history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure should be monitored.
