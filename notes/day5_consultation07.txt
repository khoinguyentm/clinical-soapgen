 SOAP Note:

Subjective: The patient, Sandra Bullock (DOB: February 20th, 1958), reported a persistent cough that started about five days ago and a constantly streaming nose. She mentioned experiencing symptoms of feeling hot but also chilly at times, as well as having achy muscles.

Objective: The patient's vital signs were not recorded during the virtual consultation. However, she confirmed that her temperature has not been checked recently and mentioned that she has diarrhea for a short period around when the symptoms started but it has since improved. She also noted that her chest is clear to auscultation and there are no signs of respiratory distress. The nose discharge appears green, but no blood or other abnormalities were observed.

Assessment: It appears that the patient may have an upper respiratory tract infection, likely viral in nature. The persistent cough and nasal congestion suggest this, along with the intermittent fever symptoms. Given her history of diabetes, it is important to monitor for potential complications, such as bacterial infections.

Plan: Recommend that the patient take her temperature using a thermometer, check for ongoing high temperatures (above 37.5°C or 38°C) and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen, coughing up large amounts of phlegm, blood, or having difficulty breathing or chest pain. Advise the patient to continue taking lemon sips as needed but avoid combining it with other paracetamol-containing products. Suggest that she continues to monitor her diabetes and blood pressure as instructed by her primary care physician. Encourage her to attend routine checkups.
