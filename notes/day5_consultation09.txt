1. Blood tests to check for potential bacterial infections, including Lyme disease.
2. Follow up appointment a week after blood test results are received, either over the phone or in person if necessary.
3. Encourage patient to continue using their preventative asthma inhaler as prescribed.
4. Monitor patient's symptoms and energy levels in the meantime.
