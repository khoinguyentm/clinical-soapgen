 Subjective: The patient, Tina Smith, a 40-year-old female, reports feeling wheezy and experiencing shortness of breath for the past two days. She mentions that it started after cleaning her house, suggesting an allergy to dust may be the cause. She also notes that she has had asthma as a child and occasionally experiences hay fever during summer months.

   Objective: The patient's vital signs were not recorded during this consultation. However, she reports feeling anxious about her current state due to difficulty breathing and speaking.

   Assessment: Tina Smith presents with symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath, likely triggered by an allergen. Given her history of asthma and hay fever, it is possible that she is experiencing an exacerbation of these conditions or a new allergic reaction to dust. The patient's speech was clear, and there were no signs of dizziness or chest pain.

   Plan: The patient will be referred to a nearby clinic for further testing, including oxygen saturation measurement, to rule out asthma or an allergy. She has been advised to take an antihistamine, if available, as a precautionary measure, and will receive a letter from the doctor for her GP for a follow-up appointment. The patient should expect the consultation with her GP to last around ten minutes.
