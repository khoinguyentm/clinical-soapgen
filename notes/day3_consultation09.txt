 Subjective: The patient, Mary Smith, is a 45-year-old female who presents with left arm numbness, tingling in the fingertips of the second, third, and fourth fingers (palm side), and weakness in the same arm. She also reports having pain in her jaw and some trouble seeing from her left eye for about twenty minutes a few weeks ago. The patient mentions that she has been taking boxing classes, which she believes might be related to her current symptoms. She takes Ibuprofen for muscle pain, Vitamin D, iron supplements (irregularly), and Melatonin to aid sleep. The patient's past medical history includes a cold about a month ago and her father has hypothyroidism and autoimmune issues while her mother suffers from diabetes type 2, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

   Objective: The patient's arm shows numbness, tingling, and weakness. Visual acuity and reflexes were not assessed during the consultation. There is no information about the jaw pain other than it being mentioned.

   Assessment: It is likely that Mary Smith has a neurological issue such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) due to her symptoms of numbness, tingling, and weakness in the left arm, visual problems, and her family history of autoimmune issues. An urgent neurology referral will be made for further evaluation and potential brain scans.

   Plan: The patient will receive an immediate neurology referral for further investigation and evaluation. She was advised to monitor for any progression of weakness, headaches, vomiting, fits, or worsening visual symptoms and to seek urgent care (A&E) if these occur. No medication was prescribed during the consultation.
