 SOAP Note:

Subjective:
- Patient Tracy Chapman is a 45-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath and a persistent cough for one day. She reported a slight fever, and on two occasions, she coughed up blood. The patient also mentioned feeling her heart beating faster than usual and being tired at work for the past couple of weeks.
- The patient lives alone in a flat and has a cat as a pet. She works in an office doing a desk job.
- The patient is currently on Methotrexate for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and has no other diagnoses or allergies.

Objective:
- Vital Signs: Pulse rate approximately 66-74 beats per minute. No apparent abnormalities found in blood pressure, temperature, or circulation tests during the virtual consultation. No enlarged glands were detected upon neck examination.
- The patient was unable to have a throat exam due to the virtual nature of the consultation.

Assessment:
The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible chest infection. Given her recent shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and slight fever, further assessment is needed to rule out Pneumonia or other complications. The patient may require an antibiotic and a face-to-face examination by a GP to listen to her chest, check her blood pressure, and pulse again.

Plan:
- Arrange for the patient to be reviewed in a clinic today for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs.
- The GP will perform a comprehensive physical exam, including listening to the patient's chest, checking her blood pressure, and pulse. They may also recheck her temperature.
- If needed, an antibiotic may be prescribed. However, no medications were prescribed during this virtual consultation due to the need for further assessment.
- The patient will be informed of the possibility of needing follow-up investigations such as a chest X-ray if symptoms persist or do not improve.
- Encourage the patient to contact our support team to book the face-to-face appointment with a GP.
