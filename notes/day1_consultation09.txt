 **Subjective:**
   - Patient is a 19-year-old female named Jessica Smith who presents with symptoms of lower abdominal pain and burning upon urination that have persisted for a few days. She reports some cramping in the lower abdomen, but denies fevers, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. There was minimal blood present in her urine today, but she describes an odd smell.
   - Jessica is sexually active with a boyfriend and has not had an STD screen. She uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was three weeks ago, and she does not believe she could be pregnant. She also reports having IBS in the past but no other significant medical history.
   - Jessica lives in a flat near her college with friends and is currently a student studying biology.

   **Objective:**
   - No objective data was collected during this encounter as it focused primarily on obtaining the patient's history.

   **Assessment:**
   - Based on the presented symptoms, it appears Jessica may have a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, further examination and possible testing will be needed to confirm this diagnosis.

   **Plan:**
   - Begin treatment with antibiotics, either Nitrofurantoin or Trimethoprim, for a three-day course.
   - Advise Jessica to drink plenty of fluids to help flush the infection from her system.
   - Encourage her to return if symptoms persist after completing the antibiotic course or if she develops any additional concerning symptoms (high temperatures, back pain, worsening general health).
   - Discuss the importance of avoiding sexual activity while her symptoms are present and continuing to use barrier contraception.
