 Subjective: The patient reported feeling good initially but subsequently described feeling bad due to a skin problem. They have noticed their skin becoming sore, red, itchy, and dry over the past few days, particularly on the inside of their elbows. The affected areas are not weeping or showing signs of scratch marks, but there are cracks present.

   Objective: On examination, the patient has widespread eczema affecting their chest, hands, and arms, with the worst area being the inside of the elbows. There is no thickened or darkened skin observed. The patient has a history of eczema and has been using diprobase cream and dermal soap in the shower for management. They have also used steroids in the past but are currently unsure which one they are using. The patient does not take any antihistamines. The patient has asthma and uses a blue inhaler only when needed, with no current breathing issues. Other than eczema, the patient does not report any other medical conditions.

   Assessment: The patient presents with an exacerbation of their eczema, affecting multiple areas of their body. They are currently using hydrocortisone cream and have used steroids in the past but are unsure which one they are currently using. Antihistamines have not been tried, although the patient reports no improvement when taken.

   Plan: The patient will be prescribed Fexofenadine antihistamine and Betnovate cream to manage their eczema symptoms. They should use a small amount of Betnovate cream twice daily for the next couple of weeks. If there is no improvement or an adverse reaction occurs, the patient should contact the doctor immediately. The patient should continue using their emollients (diprobase and dermal soap) in the interim. If symptoms worsen in the next two weeks, the patient should call the doctor beforehand. The prescription will be sent to Boots pharmacy for collection. The patient was informed to take care and the consultation ended amicably.
