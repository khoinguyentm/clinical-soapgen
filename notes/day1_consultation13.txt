 Subjective: Adriana Katherine (Age 26) presents with a headache that started three days ago and has been gradually worsening over that time. The pain is located around her right eye, is dull but can become sharp, and comes and goes. She rates the pain as an 8 out of 10. She also reports increased sensitivity to light and finding it difficult to focus. She has taken Ibuprofen for the past two days without improvement. Other symptoms include neck stiffness, and difficulty focusing. There is no history of recent head injuries, fevers, rashes, or any other medical issues. Adriana lives with three housemates, works in IT, and wears glasses. She smokes socially and drinks only socially. She mentions a family history of migraines but has never had one herself.

Objective: On examination, Adriana appears to be in mild distress. Her pupils are reactive to light without any signs of papilledema or visual field defects. There is no nystagmus, extraocular muscle palsies, or other signs of neurological deficit. Neck examination reveals no focal tenderness or stiffness.

Assessment: Adriana's symptoms are consistent with a possible migraine. The fact that she has a family history of migraines supports this diagnosis. However, without a definitive clinical examination and further investigations, it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis at this stage.

Plan: In the meantime, I will prescribe Adriana stronger painkillers such as Naproxen and Paracetamol or Codeine. She should keep a headache diary to help us identify any potential triggers for her headaches. Adriana is to return in one to two weeks if her headaches persist or worsen, at which point we can discuss prophylactic medications. If she experiences any visual problems, weakness in her arms and legs, or is feeling generally unwell, she should contact me immediately.
