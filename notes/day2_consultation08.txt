 Subjective: The patient, Sarah Smith, born on November 2nd, 1992, presented with a chief complaint of fever and general unwellness for approximately one week. She reported feeling hot and sweaty all the time, nauseous, and having aching muscles throughout her body. She has been taking ibuprofen and paracetamol but finds it only slightly effective in reducing her temperature. Other symptoms include sweating during the night, feeling cold, and being generally tired.

   Objective: The patient's vital signs were not documented in this transcript. Her ears are reported to be fine. She has a habitual headache related to screen use, weather changes, and high pressure days. No rash, joint pain, or urinary problems were reported. She has a history of back pain for which she is under a physiotherapist's care. Her family history includes heart attack (father passed away in his sixties). She is allergic to pollen and takes Seroxat as medication. She works as a nurse and has moderate alcohol intake.

   Assessment: The patient is suffering from flu-like symptoms with fever, muscle aches, and general malaise for about one week. The cause of her fever is not clear. Given her recent travel to Vietnam, there is a possibility of exotic infections such as malaria. A thorough physical examination and blood tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. She should avoid work until the cause of her symptoms is determined.

   Plan: The patient will be asked to attend one of the clinic's locations for a physical examination and blood tests, specifically thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers. The urgency of these tests depends on the findings during the examination. If it is inconvenient for her to come into central London, she can attend a local A&E. She should not go to work until this issue is resolved. The admin team will be contacted to arrange an appointment.
