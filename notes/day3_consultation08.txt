The cough is dry in nature and he has been taking paracetamol for pain relief. He is a diabetic, using metformin for management, and has been diabetic for about 5-6 years. He monitors his blood sugars at home without issues. His last reported blood pressure reading was within normal range this morning.

   **Objective:** On physical examination, there was mild redness at the back of the patient's throat with no enlarged tonsils or noticeable lymph nodes.

   **Assessment:** The patient is experiencing a viral infection likely causing his cold and cough symptoms. There are no signs of chest infection such as wheezing or shortness of breath.

   **Plan:** The patient was advised to use over-the-counter medications like Night Nurse and Day Nurse for symptom relief.
