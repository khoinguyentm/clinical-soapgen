 Subjective: The patient, Oscar, expressed concerns about shortness of breath that has worsened over the last couple of weeks, particularly in the past few days. He mentioned experiencing a dry cough and swelling in both ankles for the past few days. He reported no chest pain or palpitations. He described feeling a bit run-down but otherwise normal.

   Objective: The patient's respiratory rate was not specified, his heart rate and rhythm were normal, and his blood pressure was within normal limits. There was no evidence of chest pain or palpitations. His lungs were clear to auscultation and his oxygen saturation was within normal limits. His abdomen was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. Both ankles were swollen.

   Assessment: Oscar has a history of heart failure, for which he is currently on diuretics (Furosemide). He also had a small heart attack about five years ago, but the exact diagnosis is unclear. In the past few days, he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, dry cough, and swelling in both ankles. He reported no chest pain, palpitations, or fever. His general health otherwise seems to be normal.

   Plan: The patient will increase his Furosemide dose from one tablet a day to two tablets a day for the first few days. A blood test and echocardiogram of his heart will be scheduled to assess his heart function. The patient will return for follow-up in about a week to discuss his progress. He has been advised to contact the doctor if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness before the scheduled appointment.
