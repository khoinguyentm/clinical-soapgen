Plan:
1. Continue ice therapy as much as possible
2. Ease up on running if it becomes painful enough to stop
3. Prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory medication (not with Ibuprofen)
4. Refer for physiotherapy assessment and examination of the knee
5. Advise returning if symptoms worsen or become urgent (persistent swelling, heat, redness, high temperature, complete locking up of the knee)
6. Send prescription for stronger anti-inflammatory to the patient's pharmacy.
