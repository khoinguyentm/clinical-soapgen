Objective:
- A headache on the left side at the back of the head.
- Intensity rate of 8 out of 10.
- No other accompanying symptoms.
- Vital signs not recorded during this encounter.

Assessment:
- The patient presents with a new-onset, moderate to severe left-sided occipital headache without any clear etiology or associated symptoms. Given the patient's denial of stress, dietary changes, or other lifestyle modifications, further investigation may be warranted. The possibility of migraine should be considered due to the patient's family history.

Plan:
- Prescribe a stronger pain relief medication similar to Ibuprofen (e.g., Naproxen) and advise taking it regularly with food.
- Advise rest, hydration, and the use of Paracetamol if needed.
- Instruct the patient to seek further medical attention if symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or if episodes recur. This includes fever, rash, vomiting, neck stiffness, or continued headaches that are not settling with medication.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment or arrange for telephone consultation within the next 24-48 hours to reassess and adjust management as needed.
