 Subjective: The patient reported experiencing diarrhea for the last three days, with loose and watery stools going to the toilet six to seven times a day. They also complained of lower abdominal pain on the left side that comes and goes and feels like a muscular cramp. The patient mentioned feeling weak and shaky but has not had a fever since the symptoms started three days ago. The patient also reported a loss of appetite but has been able to hold down fluids. They have vomited at the start of the symptoms but stopped doing so since then.

Objective: The physical examination was not performed in this transcript, but the patient's symptoms suggest possible gastroenteritis.

Assessment: The patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis, a viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines. The patient's weakness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite are indicative of this condition.

Plan: The plan is to recommend conservative management for the patient, including staying well-hydrated by drinking fluids and taking oral rehydration salts like Dioralyte. Paracetamol can be taken for fever relief. The patient is advised to take time off work for two to three days to rest and allow the infection to clear from their system. If symptoms persist beyond three to four days, a follow-up appointment will be necessary, and further tests such as taking a sample of the patient's stool may be required.
