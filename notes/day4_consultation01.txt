 Subjective: The patient reported a sudden onset of chest discomfort that has been ongoing for a few hours, which he described as feeling like someone is sitting on his chest. He rated the discomfort at about 7 out of 10, with ten being very severe pain. The patient also reported shortness of breath and lightheadedness, and stated that he has high blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol but does not take any medication for these conditions.

   Objective: The patient's vital signs were not recorded during this interaction. The patient described the location of his chest discomfort as being in the middle of his chest, and he also reported some pain in his left shoulder and arm. He mentioned that he has noticed nausea but no vomiting, and he has not eaten anything today. He also stated that he has difficulty climbing stairs and walking uphill, and feels limited in performing daily activities.

   Assessment: The patient is experiencing chest discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and some pain in his left shoulder and arm. Given the patient's past medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol, and the nature of his symptoms, there is concern for a possible cardiac issue. The patient should be evaluated by emergency medical services as soon as possible due to these concerns.

   Plan: The patient will call an ambulance to have them come to his address. In the meantime, he should stay on the phone with the doctor so that more information can be gathered for the paramedics. The patient should remain calm and stay hydrated. When the paramedics arrive, they will assess the patient's chest (heart) and breathing (lungs). The patient will then be taken to the hospital where he will be seen by a consultant immediately. Once the patient has been evaluated at the hospital, the doctor will follow up with him for further management.
