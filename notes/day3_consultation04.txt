 Subjective:
- Patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of asthma and possible eczema. He has been experiencing tightness in his chest for the past 2 to 3 days, shortness of breath during brisk walking, wheezing, and coughing. His symptoms have not improved with the use of his blue inhaler (Salbutamol).
- The patient lives at 191 EZ Great Road SW, London.

Objective:
- The patient's chest was examined for signs of respiratory distress. No sputum was produced. His peak flow reading when he is good is about 380. He does not have any known allergies to medication.

Assessment:
- The patient appears to be experiencing an asthma exacerbation with possible concurrent eczema.

Plan:
- The patient will be scheduled for a face-to-face appointment with a GP in the near future. In the interim, he is advised to increase his brown inhaler (Clenil) dosage from 3 puffs twice daily to 4 puffs twice daily and use the blue inhaler (Salbutamol) every 2 hours as needed. If breathing worsens significantly before the appointment, the patient should seek emergency care at A&E without delay. The patient was given instructions on increasing his steroid intake while waiting for his appointment. He has been advised to perform peak flow readings and may need antibiotics or oral steroids if necessary upon evaluation.
