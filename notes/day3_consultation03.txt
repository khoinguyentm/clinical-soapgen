 Subjective: The patient, Peter Peterson, reported feeling down, lack of appetite and energy, shortness of breath, and nausea for the past few months to several years. He also mentioned changes in bowel habits with occasional nausea but no diarrhea or blood in stool.

Observation: The patient appeared to be in a secure location and was able to communicate effectively during the consultation. His speech was clear, and he responded appropriately to questions. No signs of chest pain were reported.

Assessment: Peter Peterson may be experiencing symptoms of depression, possibly triggered by recent changes at work or other stressors. Weight loss and fatigue are also significant findings. The patient's history of underactive thyroid may complicate the diagnosis, but a general set of blood tests is recommended as an initial step.

Plan: Arrange for a blood test to assess anemia, kidney function, liver function, vitamin levels, and other parameters. If the results are normal, arrange for a physical examination. Inform the patient about the importance of reporting any chest pain or changes in bowel habits. Provide guidance on how to contact support for arranging the blood test and further management. Encourage the patient to seek immediate help if symptoms worsen.
