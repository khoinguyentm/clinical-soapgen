 SOAP Note:

Subjective: The patient, Itha, aged 26, presented with symptoms of dry and itchy skin on her arms and hands, which started a few days ago. She reported feeling stressed at work due to annoyance from the children and long working hours. She mentioned that her skin is red and has been using coconut butter for relief, but it hasn't helped with the itch. She denied any other symptoms such as fever, spots, soreness, cracked skin, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in urination.

Objective: On examination, there was no visual evidence of other symptoms. The skin on her arms and hands appeared dry, red, and mildly itchy. No other abnormalities were found.

Assessment: The patient likely has dermatitis, possibly triggered by stress and swimming. The lack of other symptoms and normal vital signs support this diagnosis.

Plan: The patient was advised to use a steroid cream for inflammation and emollients for dry skin. Over-the-counter antihistamines such as Piriton or Loratadine were recommended to help with the itchiness. Paracetamol was not considered necessary at this time. The patient was advised to return if symptoms persist after a few days.
