 Subjective: The patient, Jim Gowers, is a 60-year-old male who presents with symptoms of chest discomfort, nausea, shortness of breath, and palpitations. He reports that the symptoms started while he was gardening and are currently present. He is alone at home and smokes 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years. He has high blood pressure but no history of diabetes or cholesterol checks. His father died of a heart attack at around 60 years old, and his mother had heart problems. The patient drinks about 7-8 pints (beer) of alcohol per week and is overweight. He reports an allergic reaction to aspirin.

   Objective: The patient's blood pressure was not recorded during this interaction. The patient's chest was described as having diffuse pain in the middle of his chest, with spreading pain to his left arm and shoulder. His heart rate is increased due to stress. No physical examination was performed during this interaction.

   Assessment: Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, there is a high suspicion for a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient should be immediately evaluated by emergency medical services and taken to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

   Plan: An ambulance will be called for the patient, who will receive an ECG upon arrival at the hospital. Based on the ECG results, the patient may be admitted for further testing and management. The patient's allergic reaction to aspirin should be communicated to the hospital staff. The patient should refrain from smoking and alcohol consumption during this time. Further follow-up with a cardiologist will be necessary.
