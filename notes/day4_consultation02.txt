 Subjective: The patient, Patrick Smith, reports feeling hot and experiencing severe headaches that are affecting his work. These headaches come on randomly during work times and feel like they are in the front of his head. He also experiences nausea, reduced appetite, and weight loss (5 pounds unintentionally), tingling sensations in both arms, shortness of breath, and a racing heartbeat once or more per day. These symptoms began around the time he changed jobs. The patient is a lawyer working in London and reports high stress levels at work (7-8 out of 10). He also has hyperthyroidism, which he manages with medication.

Objective: During the phone call, the patient's vitals were not assessed. No physical examination was performed. The patient did not mention any recent injuries or surgeries.

Assessment: The patient presents with symptoms that may be related to stress, migraines, or a neurological issue. A thorough examination and blood tests, including thyroid function tests, are recommended to further investigate the cause of his symptoms.

Plan: The patient will make an appointment for an in-person examination at the clinic. Blood tests for thyroxine levels will be ordered. If the symptoms persist or worsen, a referral to a neurologist may be necessary. The patient will continue to take his medication for hyperthyroidism as prescribed. The patient was advised to avoid excessive alcohol consumption and not to use recreational drugs. The patient was reassured that he would not have to repeat the information provided during his initial call to the doctor when he comes in for his appointment.
