Objective: Patient is a 27-year-old male named John Doe, born on November 17th, 1991. No history of anaphylaxis or EpiPen use. Reported symptoms include difficulty breathing, slight swelling in lips (patient unclear if it has fully swollen up yet), and a rash with a puncture mark on his arm where he was stung.

Assessment: The patient is experiencing anxiety due to an insect bite, which may cause a localized allergic reaction. He appears anxious about potential worsening of symptoms but does not appear to be in immediate danger.

Plan: The patient will take over-the-counter antihistamines (e.g., Piriton or Chlorphenamine) as needed for symptom relief, up to 6 times a day. If the redness on his arm spreads, he should consider antibiotics if it feels hot or if there are signs of localized infection. The patient will be warned to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen, especially in terms of breathing difficulties. The patient will be provided with information about anaphylactic reactions for awareness purposes and encouraged to contact the healthcare provider if concerned. The healthcare provider will monitor the patient's progress and consider allergy testing if the incidents become recurrent.
