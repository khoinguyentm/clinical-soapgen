 Subjective: The patient, John Smith, is a 53-year-old male who presents with a left elbow swelling that he noticed about a week ago. He reports no pain but describes the area as slightly warm and experiencing a sensation of fluid inside. He denies any history of injury to the elbow and does not engage in physically demanding work. The patient reports an allergy to peanuts and is otherwise healthy, with regular exercise habits including running three times a week.

Objective: On examination, the elbow appears slightly warm to touch but there is no significant redness or tenderness. The skin on the tip of the elbow appears dry. No other areas of dry skin were noted. The patient's joint mobility appears normal.

Assessment: The patient is suspected to have Bursitis based on the presentation and lack of history of trauma. The patient will be started on anti-inflammatory medication and blood tests will be ordered to rule out other causes of joint swelling, including rheumatological conditions and infection. The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention if the elbow becomes very red, very painful, and the redness spreads or intensifies, as this could indicate septic arthritis.

Plan: The patient will be sent blood test forms for home collection. Results are expected in 5-6 days. A follow-up appointment will be arranged for review of the joint and blood test results. This can be a face-to-face or virtual appointment at the patient's convenience. The patient was advised to continue with regular exercise and prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg twice daily after food. The patient was instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or if there are any concerns.
