 Subjective: The patient, Tim, reports lower abdominal pain that started two days ago and is getting worse. He describes it as a burning sensation below his belly button. The pain is constant but not debilitating. Additionally, the patient has been feeling hot and sweaty.

Objective: The patient's bowel movements are normal now after experiencing constipation for about a week prior. There were no symptoms of diarrhea or loose stools. The urine was pink but there was no burning or stinging pain when passing urine. The patient has been peeing more frequently, possibly due to increased fluid intake.

Assessment: Tim presents with lower abdominal pain that is gradually worsening. He also reports feeling hot and sweaty. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible cause of his symptoms, especially given the pink urine. However, as he mentions a burning sensation in the lower abdomen, other possibilities such as appendicitis or a gynecological issue should be considered since he is sexually active and on hormonal contraception.

Plan: Empirical treatment for a UTI with antibiotics (Trimethoprim) will be initiated. However, it's important to arrange a pregnancy test to rule out that as a possibility. The patient should return if symptoms do not improve or worsen and monitor for signs of worsening abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting. Regular Paracetamol can be taken for pain relief and cranberry juice may help with urinary symptoms.
