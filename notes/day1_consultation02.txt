 Subjective: The patient describes a 4-day history of an itchy, sore skin rash that primarily affects the chest, hands, and elbows, but also extends to other parts of the body. The rash is associated with significant discomfort, causing difficulty sleeping, focusing on work, and engaging in activities such as hiking. The patient has a history of eczema and was previously prescribed a cream for this condition, but it has not been effective in alleviating the current symptoms.

   Objective: On physical examination, the patient's skin appears dry, cracked in some areas, and is very itchy. The patient also mentions no bleeding or discharge from the affected skin.

   Assessment: The assessment suggests a possible flare-up of the patient's eczema. However, the rash is now affecting areas beyond the arms, and the symptoms seem more severe than previous episodes.

   Plan: The doctor plans to prescribe a stronger steroid cream for the patient, along with emollients to moisturize the skin. The patient will also be advised to use antihistamines such as Loratadine or Piriton to help with the itchiness. The doctor encourages the patient to keep a diary of potential triggers that may exacerbate the symptoms. If symptoms do not improve, the patient is instructed to return for further evaluation and management. The patient is also given Fexofenadine, a stronger antihistamine, to try.
