 Subjective: The patient, Michael John, presented with a complaint of diarrhea for the past 3 days. He appears to be confused about what to do and is experiencing appetite loss. He mentioned that he had vomited once and has experienced some abdominal pain. There was no report of blood or mucus in the stool. The patient reported feeling a little feverish, but not excessively concerned.

Objective: Vital signs were not reported. The patient's abdomen was not palpated or auscultated. No physical examination was performed as the consultation was conducted virtually. The patient confirmed that he had asthma and is currently using an inhaler (Lexapro, presumably a mistake in transcription as it's not a recognized asthma medication). He also mentioned that his father had hypertension and died of bowel cancer ten years ago. No other medical history was provided.

Assessment: The patient is experiencing non-bloody diarrhea for 3 days with some abdominal pain and vomiting once. There is no fever or mucus in the stool reported. The patient's hydration status appears to be okay as he is still able to drink plenty of water.

Plan: The patient was advised to follow a soft diet (crackers, toast, jam) for the time being and avoid dairy, fish, meat, and eggs. Once the diarrhea improves, he can gradually reintroduce these foods. Yoghurt was suggested due to its probiotic properties to help restore gut bacteria. If the diarrhea persists for a week or if he starts passing blood, a stool sample will be required. The patient was also advised to look out for signs of dehydration such as increased frequency of diarrhea (more than 6-8 times a day) and to seek immediate medical attention if this occurs. Over-the-counter rehydration solutions like Dioralyte were recommended. The patient was reminded that all advice given during the consultation will be recorded in his app for future reference. The patient was dismissed with instructions to take care.
