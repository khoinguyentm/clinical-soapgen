 Subjective: The patient, Dan Choudhry, reports feeling unwell for the past three days with symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. He also mentions a family history of colon cancer in his father.

Observable: The patient is able to communicate effectively via audio call. His speech is coherent, but he appears to be experiencing some discomfort due to his symptoms.

Assessment: The symptoms suggest a possible case of gastroenteritis. However, the patient's father has colon cancer in the third stage, which could potentially complicate the diagnosis.

Plan: The patient will be advised to drink plenty of fluids and consider using over-the-counter solutions like Diarolyte for fluid replacement. He can continue taking Paracetamol for pain relief and fever reduction. If symptoms do not improve within 48 hours, further investigations may be necessary. The patient has been asked to contact the doctor if concerns about dehydration arise. Alcohol consumption should be avoided. The patient will be followed up in the next one to two days.
