Objective:
- Not applicable as this was a telephone consultation.

Assessment:
- Migraine or tension headache possibly related to stress and anxiety. The patient reports sensitivity to light, and has a history of anxiety. However, the headaches are usually frontal but have recently become more prominent on one side, which makes migraine a possibility.

Plan:
1. Prescribe Ibuprofen for pain relief as first line treatment for suspected migraine. Patient may continue to take Paracetamol if desired.
2. Encourage the patient to explore counselling options and consider taking some time off work to reduce stress.
3. Arrange a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess the situation and consider other possibilities if symptoms do not improve.
4. Advise the patient to ensure they are getting enough sleep (7-8 hours per night), drinking adequate fluids (1.5-2 liters per day) and monitor for any worsening of symptoms or concerning signs. Provide resources on headache danger signs and symptoms in the consultation notes.
